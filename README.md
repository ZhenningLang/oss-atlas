# oss-atlas

**A natural-language, agent-first index for open-source *selection* (选型).**
When a coding agent gets a task, it reads this index to pick the right OSS project —
weighing *when NOT to use* each option, not just what it does.

> 中文版 README：[README.zh.md](README.zh.md)

## Install

Install the **`select-oss`** skill into your coding agent — one skill that teaches the agent to
navigate this index and pick OSS for a task. It reads the public index over HTTP (no local copy
needed) and works in a clone too.

**Any agent, via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh)** (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Droid,
Kilo, Gemini CLI, Copilot, and ~70 more — the CLI knows each agent's skills path):

```bash
# Global (all your projects); drop -g for project-local. Pick agents with -a, e.g. -a claude-code
npx skills add ZhenningLang/oss-atlas -g
```

**Manual** (no Node) — copy the skill folder into your agent's skills dir, e.g. Claude Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZhenningLang/oss-atlas
cp -r oss-atlas/skills/select-oss ~/.claude/skills/
```

The skill fetches pages from `raw.githubusercontent.com/ZhenningLang/oss-atlas/main/`; only the
single `SKILL.md` is installed, so it stays tiny and always reads the latest index. For agents
without web access, the skill falls back to a local clone.

## Projects

The complete index, grouped by category. Each project has an English page (`<slug>.md`) and a Chinese sibling (`<slug>.zh.md`) — click straight through. Browse interactively from [INDEX.md](INDEX.md); agents start at [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

| **VMAF** | Use it when you're tuning an encoding ladder and need a perceptual 0-100 score to compare codecs/presets the way the industry does — but it's full-reference only, and picking the wrong model silently invalidates cross-version comparisons. | BSD-2-Clause-Patent | B (5/6) | [EN](categories/media-processing/quality-metrics/vmaf.md) · [中](categories/media-processing/quality-metrics/vmaf.zh.md) |

| **newspaper** | Use it to bulk-extract article text, authors, and metadata from news URLs — but the original (newspaper3k) is stale; the live path is the newspaper4k fork. | MIT | B (5/6) | [EN](categories/web-scraping/article-extraction/newspaper.md) · [中](categories/web-scraping/article-extraction/newspaper.zh.md) |

### databases

| Project | Use when | License | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **PikiwiDB** | Use it when a large Redis dataset has blown past RAM and memory cost dominates — RocksDB-backed, Redis-protocol, so one node holds hundreds of GB; but it trades latency for capacity, wrong if every op must be microsecond-fast. | BSD-3-Clause | B (5/6) | [EN](categories/databases/database-engines/pikiwidb.md) · [中](categories/databases/database-engines/pikiwidb.zh.md) |

### networking

| Project | Use when | License | Health | Page |

| **dnspython** | Use it when Python needs arbitrary record types, custom resolvers, zone transfers, DNSSEC, or DoH/DoT — but it bypasses /etc/hosts and the OS resolver, requires Python 3.10+, and is a library not a CLI. | ISC | B (5/6) | [EN](categories/networking/dnspython.md) · [中](categories/networking/dnspython.zh.md) |
| **wondershaper** | Use it when one Linux NIC needs a quick up/down bandwidth ceiling without hand-writing tc rules — but it's HTB-era (not bufferbloat-aware like cake/fq_codel) and Linux-only, coasting since 2024-07. | GPL-2.0 | D (4/6) | [EN](categories/networking/wondershaper.md) · [中](categories/networking/wondershaper.zh.md) |

| **nginx-upload-module** | Use it when you want NGINX to stream large multipart uploads to disk and hand your backend just file metadata — but you're compiling an aging, single-maintainer C fork (last push 2024-07); direct-to-S3 presigned uploads often beat it now. | BSD-3-Clause | ?

### terminal-ui

Categories follow the tree in [INDEX.md](INDEX.md).
| **Readability.js** | Use it when you need to strip a web page down to just the article (title, byline, body) using Firefox Reader View's battle-tested engine — but it parses a DOM you supply; it won't fetch URLs or render JS-heavy SPAs. | Apache-2.0 | [EN](categories/web-scraping/article-extraction/readability-js.md) · [中](categories/web-scraping/article-extraction/readability-js.zh.md) |

## Why this exists

Most OSS READMEs are marketing: they tell you what a project does and why it's great. They do
**not** tell you when *not* to use it, how it compares to alternatives, or what it costs to
operate. An agent doing selection needs exactly that negative space. oss-atlas inverts the
README genre into a **decision-support** genre.

The index is deliberately **weak** — no database, no search, no embeddings. Just Markdown that
an agent reads and reasons over. The directory structure *is* the query API.

## Selection signals & heuristics

Choosing OSS is a bet on the future, not just a feature match. Every page carries a
**`Health & viability`** section — a dated, labeled verdict on whether the project is worth betting
on: maintenance cadence, governance & bus factor, backing org, adoption/ecosystem, and risk flags
(relicense history, open-core gating, CVEs). Read it alongside `When NOT to use`.

One prior deserves a name — the **Lindy effect**: for non-perishable things (software, formats,
tools), expected *remaining* life grows with current age. A project **actively maintained** for 12
years is a safer long-term bet than one that exploded in 6 months. Treat it as a prior, not a law,
and always as **age × still-active**: it discounts young-but-hyped repos (suspicious stars, unproven)
and does **not** rescue old **abandoned** ones (age alone ≠ alive); it can also mislead across
paradigm shifts. Pages record the project's **age** so the prior is checkable. [推断: the Lindy
framing is a heuristic, not a guarantee of any specific project's survival.]

## Structure (recursive tree, bilingual)

```
INDEX.md / INDEX.zh.md                        # root: category route (EN / 中)
categories/<cat>/INDEX.md / INDEX.zh.md       # a category node: pages + sub-categories
categories/<cat>/<subcat>/INDEX.md …          # deeper nodes — the tree self-balances as it grows
…/<slug>.md  +  …/<slug>.zh.md                # a leaf: the EN selection page + its 中文 sibling
```

`categories/` is a **recursive, self-balancing tree**: when a category gets too many projects it
splits into sub-categories (the linter WARNs; `refactor-index` does the split). English is the
agent-canonical path; the `.zh.md` sibling is the same content in Chinese.

### Anatomy of a project page

Each page = **YAML frontmatter (facts, dated)** + **Markdown body (judgment)**. The two are kept
apart on purpose: facts go stale and get re-verified (`last_verified`); judgment is opinion and is
labeled (`[未验证]` / `[推断]`), never asserted as eternal truth.

**Frontmatter** (identical across the EN/中 pair — facts are language-neutral):
`name · slug · repo · category · tags · language · license · maturity` (dated) · `last_verified` · `type`
(`tool | library | app | framework | service | model | skill-pack`).

**Body sections** (the exact set depends on `type`):

| Section (EN / 中) | Required for | What it carries |
|---|---|---|
| `When to use` / `何时使用` | all types | a **User Story** — a concrete second-person scenario, not a feature list |
| `When NOT to use` / `何时不用` | all types | the decisive filter: anti-patterns, scale ceilings, lock-in, maintenance risk |
| `Comparison` / `横向对比` | all types | a table vs real substitutes (`未收录` when an alternative isn't indexed yet) |
| `Tech stack` / `技术栈` | non-`skill-pack` | languages, frameworks, datastores it's built on |
| `Dependencies` / `依赖` | non-`skill-pack` | runtime/infra you must run (db, services, hardware) |
| `Ops difficulty` / `运维难度` | non-`skill-pack` | low / medium / high + why |
| `Health & viability` / `健康度与可持续性` | all types | dated viability verdict — maintenance, governance/bus-factor, backing, **age × Lindy**, adoption, risk flags |
| `Caveats (unverified)` / `存疑（未验证）` | all types | the uncertainty ledger — one `[未验证]`/`[推断]` bullet per unverified fact |

The full contract is [tools/schema.md](tools/schema.md); the linter ([tools/lint.py](tools/lint.py))
enforces this shape (sections, bilingual parity, fullwidth Chinese punctuation, README parity).

## Freshness

Facts go stale. Every page records `last_verified`. The linter warns when an entry is older
than 90 days; the `sync-entry` skill re-verifies it against the live repo. Treat any fact as a
**point-in-time** snapshot, labeled per the truth discipline (`[未验证]` / `[推断]`).

## Contributing

The unit of inclusion is a **git repository** — any real open-source repo, across any domain. Not
added: non-repos (hosted SaaS, landing pages, articles), exact duplicates, empty repos. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [tools/schema.md](tools/schema.md).

```bash
python3 tools/lint.py    # the structural gate; no unit tests (it's a content repo)
```

Lint is a **structural** gate (frontmatter keys + bilingual parity, required/forbidden sections per
`type`, H1, links, Caveats ledger, fanout) — not a **semantic** one. `lint clean` means the shape is
right, not that the prose was reviewed for accuracy or selection quality.
