## When to use

You want a Chinese creator-oriented Claude Code skill collection for article editing, topic generation, research, video outlines, scripts, social conversion, images, PDF export, speech coaching, and prompt saving. Choose huashu-skills when you want a broad content-creation toolbox rather than a single writing pipeline.

The upstream README describes 21 practical skills, including end-to-end workflows such as slides, data reports, Douyin scripts, and design advice, plus writing/proofreading, material search, article editing, topic generation, video checks, image generation/upload, and Markdown-to-PDF. It installs individual skills via `/install-skill https://github.com/alchaincyf/huashu-skills/tree/master/{skill名}`.

## When NOT to use

- **License clarity is required.** The README did not expose a license section in this pass and `LICENSE` returned 404; keep reuse conservative.
- **You need one strict end-to-end article production line.** [writing-agent](writing-agent.md) is more process-heavy and evidence-gated.
- **You need English SaaS marketing or growth execution.** [marketingskills](marketingskills.md) is more specialized for CRO, SEO, analytics, and sales enablement.
- **You cannot install individual subskills.** The README's installation model is per skill path, not one clearly versioned package contract.
- **You require audited output quality claims.** Claims such as AI-detection reduction, image pipelines, or report quality still require local validation.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Our verdict | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| [writing-agent](writing-agent.md) | ✅ | Choose writing-agent when one article must move through a strict staged production and fact-check workflow. | writing-agent is deeper and heavier; huashu-skills is broader and modular. |
| [Baoyu Skills](baoyu-skills.md) | ✅ | Choose Baoyu Skills for broad coding-agent utilities across translation, formatting, capture, and media. | Baoyu is more utility-oriented; huashu-skills targets Chinese creator workflows. |
| [marketingskills](marketingskills.md) | ✅ | Choose marketingskills for SaaS/growth marketing. | marketingskills is marketing-specialized; huashu-skills is creator-content oriented. |
| Custom creator toolkit | 未收录 | Choose custom when your content channels, image hosts, and editorial style are fixed. | Better local fit, but you must maintain every skill yourself. |


## Health & viability

- **Maintenance snapshot (2026-07-16):** GitHub reports `archived=false` and `pushed_at=2026-04-21T05:28:31Z`; health scores maintenance as C.
- **Adoption snapshot:** ~1,205 GitHub stars as of 2026-07; useful attention signal for a creator toolkit but not a quality proof for every subskill.
- **License snapshot:** `NOASSERTION`; root `LICENSE` returned 404 during this pass and health marks the repo as source-available/no-license.
- **Lindy / governance:** health longevity is C and governance is D due to a young, single-maintainer-centered repo.
- **Risk flags:** broad surface area, unclear license, per-skill install paths, and channel-specific dependencies such as image hosts or model APIs.

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] No root `LICENSE` file was found during this pass; do not assume permissive reuse.
- [未验证] Individual subskill behavior and external dependencies were not executed locally.
- [推断] Best fit is Chinese content-creator workflow support, not a single audited writing pipeline.
