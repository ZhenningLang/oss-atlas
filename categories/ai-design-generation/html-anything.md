# HTML Anything

A local-first Next.js web app that turns Markdown/CSV/JSON into ship-ready single-file HTML by driving the coding-agent CLI you already have logged in — zero API key, 75 skill templates across 9 deliverable surfaces, one-click export to WeChat / X / Zhihu / PNG.

## When to use

You're a developer-writer or a content/marketing operator who already has Claude Code (or Cursor / Codex / Gemini / Copilot / OpenCode / Qwen / Aider) installed and logged in, and you keep hitting the same wall: your draft is Markdown, but what your WeChat / Xiaohongshu / Zhihu audience actually sees needs to be a designed, laid-out HTML artifact — and hand-writing the CSS, type scale and grid is exactly the work you don't want to do. You run HTML Anything locally (`pnpm dev`), it auto-detects whichever agent CLI is on your `PATH`, you paste your content, pick one of the 75 skill templates (a deck, a Xiaohongshu card, a magazine article, a data report), hit ⌘+Enter, and watch the HTML stream into a sandboxed iframe line by line. When it finishes, you one-click copy juice-inlined CSS into the WeChat editor, or render a 2× PNG straight into the tweet composer — no second "I'll clean it up later" pass.

The defining trait is that it ships **no model and no API key of its own**: it spawns your local CLI with permissive flags and reuses your existing subscription session, so marginal cost is $0 and your input never leaves the machine (CSV/Excel parsing happens in-browser). That makes it a good fit when you want a opinionated, design-constrained HTML generator but refuse to wire up yet another API key or pay per-generation, and you're comfortable running a dev server on your own laptop.

## When NOT to use

- **You don't run a local coding-agent CLI.** The whole architecture is "spawn the CLI you already logged in." No `claude` / `cursor-agent` / `codex` / `gemini` / `copilot` / `opencode` / `qwen` / `aider` on `PATH` means nothing to drive — there is no built-in inference fallback.
- **You want a hosted, click-and-go SaaS.** This is a repo you clone and run; the agent always stays on your laptop. The Vercel deploy only covers the web layer, not the generation. Non-developers who won't touch a terminal are not the audience.
- **You need a single embeddable HTML-editing library or API.** It's a full app (Next.js server routes that `spawn` CLIs, a browser UI, middleware), not a drop-in component. If you want a programmatic Markdown→image/HTML function, the upstream building blocks (`markdown-nice`, `markdown-to-image`) are closer.
- **You need production-grade stability or multi-user serving.** Status is self-described "early but real," with **no tagged release** and a Security model explicitly scoped to "a single operator on a single machine" (`/api/convert` spawns the CLI with maximally permissive flags; `/api/deploy` writes credentialed config to disk). Don't expose it to a network without understanding the Host-allowlist middleware.
- **You want the bigger, faster-moving design suite.** By the README's own framing this is the *focused* HTML editor; the same team's [open-design](open-design.md) is the larger desktop app (more skills, more surfaces, PPTX/MP4 export). If you outgrow the HTML-only scope, that's the upgrade path.
- **Lock-in / lineage caveat.** Agent detection, the `SKILL.md` protocol and the design-system model are borrowed verbatim from open-design; you're adopting that ecosystem's conventions, not a neutral standard. [推断]

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| [open-design](open-design.md) | ✅ | Same team's larger desktop app — far more skills/design-systems, native desktop, PPTX/MP4 export. HTML Anything is the focused, web-only, HTML-output subset built on top of it. |
| [guizang-ppt-skill](guizang-ppt.md) | ✅ | A single agent skill for polished HTML decks (vendored into HTML Anything as `deck-guizang-editorial`). It's a skill you drop into any agent; HTML Anything is the surrounding app + picker + export + 75 skills. |
| [guizang-social-card-skill](guizang-social-card.md) | ✅ | Skill for Xiaohongshu/WeChat cover cards. Narrow + portable vs HTML Anything's broad multi-surface app. |
| [Impeccable](impeccable.md) | ✅ | A design *language* / harness-quality layer (makes any agent better at design), not a generation app. Complementary, not a substitute. |
| markdown-nice (mdnice) | not indexed | Web editor for Markdown→WeChat/Zhihu paste-ready styling; mature, no agent, theme-based not prompt-driven. HTML Anything reuses its `juice` inlining idea but adds agent generation + 9 surfaces. |
| markdown-to-image (gcui-art) | not indexed | Markdown→social-card-PNG generator; narrower output, also no local-agent model. |

## Tech stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (the running app). GitHub reports the repo as majority **HTML** because the 75 skill templates ship as HTML/`example.html` assets. [推断]
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router + Turbopack), React 19, Tailwind v4, zustand.
- **Server routes:** `GET /api/agents` (PATH scan / CLI detection), `POST /api/convert` (SSE streaming spawn), `/api/deploy`. Transport is `child_process.spawn` with one stdin/stdout adapter per CLI in `next/src/lib/agents/argv.ts`.
- **Browser-side processing:** `juice` (CSS inlining), `modern-screenshot` (PNG export), `xlsx` / `papaparse` (spreadsheet parsing), `marked` + `highlight.js` (Markdown input), `dompurify` (XSS defense).
- **Preview:** `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin">` + `srcdoc`.
- **Skill format:** Claude Code `SKILL.md` convention + extended frontmatter (`mode` · `scenario` · `surface` · `preview` · `design_system`); each skill is a folder under `next/src/lib/templates/skills/`.

## Dependencies

- **Runtime:** Node.js + `pnpm` (a small pnpm workspace: `next/` app + `e2e/` Playwright package). Exact minimum versions not pinned in the README — verify `package.json`. [未验证]
- **Required external dependency:** at least one supported coding-agent CLI installed AND already authenticated (`claude login` / `cursor login` / `gemini auth` etc.). This is the model layer — the app has none of its own.
- **Network:** templates pull Tailwind CDN / Google Fonts at preview time inside the iframe; otherwise local-first, nothing uploaded.
- **Deploy:** local `pnpm -F @html-anything/next dev`; the web layer is Vercel-deployable, but the agent must stay on the operator's machine.

## Ops difficulty

**Low for the intended single-operator local use; medium-to-high if you try to host it.** The happy path is `git clone` → `pnpm install` → `pnpm dev` → open localhost, and the value is entirely local. Friction comes from (1) the hard precondition of a logged-in agent CLI — if detection misses your binary or your session expired, nothing generates; (2) it being early with no tagged release, so you're tracking `main`; and (3) the security posture: routes spawn the CLI with maximally permissive flags and `/api/deploy` writes credentials to disk, gated only by a Host-header allowlist middleware. Exposing it beyond loopback (LAN/mDNS via `HTML_ANYTHING_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, or reverse-proxy via `HTML_ANYTHING_ALLOW_ANY_HOST=1`) shifts real security responsibility onto you. Treat it as a personal tool, not a service.

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] Star count ~7.3k as of 2026-06 — GitHub stars are unreliable and date-sensitive; treat as indicative only.
- [未验证] No tagged release exists (GitHub `latestRelease` is null as of 2026-06); "75 skills / 9 surfaces / 8 CLIs" are the project's own README figures, not independently verified, and may drift on `main`.
- [未验证] Minimum Node/pnpm versions and exact dependency pins are not stated in the README; confirm against `package.json` before relying on them.
- [推断] GitHub labels the repo "HTML" by line count, but the executable application is TypeScript/Next.js; the HTML majority is the skill-template assets.
- [推断] Agent detection, the `SKILL.md` protocol and the design-system model are described as "borrowed verbatim" from `nexu-io/open-design` (same team) and `multica-ai/multica` — adopting it means adopting that ecosystem's conventions.
- [未验证] The README's own header markets `nexu-io/open-design` as "40k★ · 200+ contributors"; those upstream figures are promotional and unverified.
- [未验证] Whether all 8 CLI adapters actually work end-to-end on a given OS/PATH layout depends on the per-CLI argv/protocol staying current with each vendor's CLI — verify your specific agent before relying on it.
