# Cua

Open-source infrastructure for **Computer-Use Agents**: VM/container sandboxes, a vision-driven Agent SDK, drivers, and benchmarks so an AI agent can control a *full desktop* (macOS, Windows, Linux, Android) by looking at the screen and clicking — not by scripting the DOM.

## When to use

You're building an automation product that has to drive **arbitrary desktop applications**, not just web pages — think a workflow that opens a native macOS app, pastes data into a legacy Windows installer, then files something in a browser. Selector-based web tools fall apart the moment the task leaves the page, and you don't want to hand-stitch a VM, a screenshot pipeline, and a model loop yourself. You also need each run to be **isolated and disposable** so an agent misclick can't touch your real machine or another tenant's data.

You reach for **Cua**. You spin up an ephemeral sandbox with one async call — `Sandbox.ephemeral(Image.macos())` or `.linux()` / `.windows()` / `.android()` — and hand it to a `ComputerAgent` that drives the desktop from screenshots, the same API regardless of OS or runtime. Because the agent layer is built on liteLLM, you point it at whatever computer-use-capable model you already pay for (Anthropic, OpenAI, and others) rather than being locked to one vendor. On Apple Silicon you can run macOS guests locally via Lume/Lumier; for scale you push the same code to Cua Cloud. When you need to prove it works, Cua-Bench scores your agent on OSWorld / ScreenSpot / Windows Arena and can export trajectories to train on.

## When NOT to use

- **You only need to automate a web page.** A full desktop VM + screenshot loop is massive overkill for filling a form or scraping a site — use an in-page or browser-level tool ([page-agent](page-agent.md), Playwright, browser-use) where DOM access is faster, cheaper, and more deterministic than vision.
- **You need low latency / high throughput per action.** Vision agents take a screenshot, call a model, and act each step — slow and token-expensive compared to DOM/selector automation. Not a fit for tight real-time loops or huge parallel fan-out on a budget.
- **You can't run VMs/containers.** This is heavyweight infra: VMs, drivers, a computer-server. macOS guests realistically need Apple Silicon (Virtualization.framework); Linux Cua Drivers are flagged pre-release.
- **You want a single stable SDK with frozen APIs.** It's a fast-moving monorepo of many independently-versioned packages (agent, sandbox, computer-server, cli, bench, train, cloud) mostly at `v0.x` — expect churn and breaking changes.
- **Closed-loop pixel-perfect reliability matters more than coverage.** Computer-use models still misclick and hallucinate UI state; for compliance-critical or irreversible actions you need guardrails the framework doesn't provide for you.
- **Data egress is sensitive.** Screenshots of the desktop are sent to your chosen model provider — review privacy/compliance before pointing it at confidential apps, and watch per-screenshot token cost.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| [page-agent](page-agent.md) | ✅ | In-page JS GUI agent driving the DOM as text inside the user's own browser — no VM, no vision, far cheaper/faster, but web-only and can't touch native desktop apps. |
| [Chrome DevTools MCP](chrome-devtools-mcp.md) | ✅ | Exposes a real Chrome via DevTools Protocol over MCP — strong for browser debugging/automation, but Chrome-scoped, not a full-desktop sandbox. |
| [Agent Browser](agent-browser.md) | ✅ | Headless browser automation CLI for agents — lightweight web-task runner; no OS-level control or VM isolation. |
| OpenAI Operator / Anthropic computer use | not indexed | Hosted vision computer-use agents — turnkey but proprietary, tied to one model vendor; Cua is the open self-hostable infra layer (and can *run* such models via liteLLM). |
| OSWorld / WebArena (benchmarks) | not indexed | Evaluation environments Cua-Bench targets — they grade agents; Cua provides the runnable sandbox + agent that gets graded. |
| E2B / Daytona (dev sandboxes) | not indexed | Code-execution sandboxes for agents — overlap on VM isolation, but oriented at running code, not screenshot-driving a GUI desktop. |

## Tech stack

- **Languages:** Python (Agent/Sandbox SDKs, computer-server), Rust (`cua-driver-rs` drivers), Swift (Lume — Apple `Virtualization.framework`), plus HTML/TypeScript in the repo.
- **Agent layer:** `cua-agent` — `ComputerAgent` loop driven by screenshots (vision), with **liteLLM** integration for model routing.
- **Sandboxing:** `cua-sandbox` SDK over Lume/Lumier (macOS/Linux VMs on Apple Silicon), Linux containers, local QEMU backends, and Cua Cloud (cua.ai).
- **Drivers:** `cua-driver-rs` / Cua Drivers — background desktop automation, also exposed as an MCP server.
- **Eval/training:** `cua-bench` (OSWorld, ScreenSpot, Windows Arena, custom tasks; trajectory export), `cua-train`.
- **Third-party:** Kasm (MIT), OmniParser (CC-BY-4.0), optional ultralytics (AGPL-3.0) — note the AGPL optional dep.

## Dependencies

- **Runtime:** Python ≥ 3.11 for the SDKs (`pip install cua`). A model endpoint usable by liteLLM (e.g. Anthropic / OpenAI computer-use-capable model) + API key.
- **Sandbox host:** for local macOS guests, an **Apple Silicon Mac** (Virtualization.framework via Lume); for Linux guests, containers or QEMU; Windows/Android guests per docs. Cua Cloud removes the local-host requirement.
- **Drivers:** installed via bash (macOS/Linux) / PowerShell (Windows) scripts; Linux driver support is pre-release.
- **Bench:** `uv tool install` for `cua-bench`.

## Ops difficulty

**Medium-to-high.** The Cloud path (cua.ai) is the easy on-ramp — managed sandboxes, no local VM to babysit. Self-hosting is heavier: you operate VMs/containers, a computer-server, and drivers, and on Apple Silicon you manage Lume/Lumier guest images. Across the many `v0.x` packages you'll track several independent version streams, and the vision agent loop adds ongoing **per-screenshot model cost/latency** plus the data-governance question of shipping desktop screenshots to a model provider. Linux drivers being pre-release means platform coverage is still uneven.

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] Star count ~19.0k (gh snapshot 2026-06-26) — GitHub stars are unreliable and date-sensitive; indicative only.
- [未验证] Package versions (cua-agent v0.8.4, cua-sandbox v0.1.17, cua-cloud v0.1.1, cua-driver-rs v0.6.8, cua-bench v0.2.11) read from the releases list dated 2026-06-24/26; treat exact numbers as snapshot-time.
- [推断] Specific supported model strings (e.g. Anthropic Claude / OpenAI computer-use-preview / UI-TARS / OmniParser loops) are inferred from the documented liteLLM integration and vision design, not quoted verbatim from a current supported-models table — verify against docs before relying on a given model.
- [推断] "Same API regardless of OS or runtime" and the `Sandbox.ephemeral(Image.macos())`-style snippet are paraphrased from the README's own framing; exact current API surface should be checked against the SDK.
- [未验证] Comparison substitutes (Operator, OSWorld/WebArena, E2B/Daytona) are partly inferred positioning from repo + secondary context, not all first-party confirmed.
- [推断] Optional ultralytics dependency is AGPL-3.0 — confirm whether your usage path pulls it in before assuming MIT-only licensing for a deployment.
