## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **colorama** | Use it when a Python CLI needs ANSI colored output that also works on legacy Windows consoles — but it's only a color/style shim (no tables, TUI, or guaranteed truecolor) and largely a no-op on modern terminals. | B (4/6) | [→](colorama.md) |
| **asciimatics** | Use it when you need a cross-platform full-screen Python TUI plus an ASCII animation engine on Linux/macOS/Windows — but the widget set is spartan, the API older-style, and it's single-maintainer. | C (5/6) | [→](asciimatics.md) |
| **Terminal Markdown Viewer (mdv)** | Use it when you want one-shot read-only Markdown rendered with color/syntax-highlighting in a plain terminal over SSH — but it's low-activity (0.x, 2024-05) and glow/mdcat are the modern defaults. | ? (2/6) | [→](terminal-markdown-viewer.md) |
| **ART** | Use it when a Python CLI needs pure-Python figlet-style ASCII text banners with no system binaries — but it's text-to-art only (not image-to-ASCII) and won't match figlet's exact fonts. | C (4/6) | [→](art.md) |
| **asciify** | Use it as a minimal, legible copy-paste reference for the image-to-ASCII algorithm — but it ships NO license (all rights reserved), is unmaintained since 2022, so never vendor it into a product. | E (4/6) | [→](asciify.md) |
| **Warp** | Use it when you want a modern, AI-powered terminal with command blocks and integrated coding agents — but the GitHub repo is issues-only; the product is proprietary closed-source. | ? (0/6) | [→](warp.md) |
| **Alacritty** | Use it when you want a fast, GPU-accelerated, cross-platform terminal emulator with sensible defaults — but it explicitly lacks tabs, splits, and ligatures, and requires OpenGL 3.3+. | ? (0/6) | [→](alacritty.md) |
| **Rich** | Rich is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal. | ? (0/6) | [→](rich.md) |
| **Textual** | The lean application framework for Python.  Build sophisticated user interfaces with a simple Python API. Run your apps in the terminal and a web browser. | ? (0/6) | [→](textual.md) |
