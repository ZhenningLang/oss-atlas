# youtube-dl

A command-line program to download video and audio from YouTube and ~1000 other sites, driven by per-site "extractor" plugins shipped in one Python package.

## When to use

You're scripting a small archival or ingest job — pulling a handful of conference talks, a podcast back-catalog, or a lecture playlist down to local files for a pipeline that then transcribes or re-encodes them. You want a single CLI you can pin in a `requirements.txt`, call from cron or a Makefile, and that returns predictable filenames via an output template (`-o '%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s'`). You reach for `youtube-dl`: one `pip install`, one invocation, optional `ffmpeg` on PATH for `--extract-audio`/`--merge-output-format`, and it resolves formats, picks the best stream, and writes the file. Because it's Python with no service to run, it slots into existing automation without standing up infrastructure.

You also use it when the source isn't YouTube at all — the value is the extractor catalog (~1000 sites: Vimeo, SoundCloud, generic HTML5 `<video>`, many regional and niche hosts). You point it at a URL, and if an extractor exists it normalizes the site's quirks (auth, pagination, manifest parsing) into a uniform `--list-formats` / format-selection interface, so your script treats every supported site the same way.

## When NOT to use

- **You need it to actually keep working on YouTube today.** This is the decisive filter. youtube-dl's last *tagged* release is 2021.12.17 and the master branch updates have slowed sharply; the actively-maintained fork **yt-dlp** ships fixes far faster and is what most people now run when YouTube changes its player/signature code. For anything load-bearing against YouTube, default to yt-dlp and treat youtube-dl as the legacy upstream. [推断]
- **JS-heavy / SPA sites with no extractor.** It does not run a browser or execute arbitrary page JavaScript; sites that gate media behind heavy client-side JS, DRM (Widevine/PlayReady), or per-request token schemes without a written extractor will simply fail. It is not a headless-browser scraper.
- **Geo-restricted, login-walled, or rate-limited at scale.** It can pass cookies/proxies, but it won't solve CAPTCHAs, rotate identities, or shield you from IP bans; bulk-downloading from one IP gets throttled or blocked. Treat geo/ToS bypass as your problem, not the tool's.
- **Legal / ToS exposure.** Downloading copyrighted media or violating a site's Terms of Service is on you; many target sites prohibit downloading, and youtube-dl itself was the subject of a 2020 DMCA takedown of its GitHub repo (later reinstated). Don't build a product on top of it without checking the law and the ToS.
- **Live streams, very large fan-out, or high concurrency.** Live capture, segmented HLS/DASH at scale, and massive parallel jobs are fragile here; yt-dlp and dedicated tools handle these better.
- **You want a library API with stability guarantees.** It can be imported (`youtube_dl.YoutubeDL`), but the internal API and extractor behavior change without notice and break easily — fine for scripts, risky as an embedded dependency.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| yt-dlp | 未收录 | The actively-maintained fork of youtube-dl; faster extractor fixes, more options (SponsorBlock, better format sorting, aria2c integration), drop-in compatible CLI. For YouTube specifically it is the de-facto successor — pick it unless you have a reason to pin upstream. |
| you-get | 未收录 | Python downloader with its own site list; simpler UX, smaller/less-actively-tracked extractor catalog than youtube-dl/yt-dlp. |
| lux | 未收录 | Go single-binary downloader (formerly annie); no Python runtime, fast, but a narrower and differently-curated site list. |
| cobalt | 未收录 | Web/API-first downloader (self-hostable service); browser-friendly and clean UX, but it's a service to run, not a pip-installable CLI for scripting. |
| gallery-dl | 未收录 | Specializes in *image/gallery* sites (boorus, social media galleries) rather than video; complementary, not a substitute for video extraction. |

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Python (runs on the system Python interpreter; historically targets a very wide range including Python 2.6/2.7 and 3.2+ per the README). [未验证]
- **Architecture:** a core downloader plus a large set of per-site **extractor** classes; format selection, output templates, and post-processors sit on top.
- **Post-processing:** shells out to external binaries — `ffmpeg`/`avconv` for audio extraction, remux, and merge; `rtmpdump` for RTMP; `mplayer`/`mpv` for some MMS/RTSP sources.
- **Distribution:** single self-contained Python zip/script, plus PyPI packaging and OS package-manager builds.

## Dependencies

- **Runtime:** a Python interpreter is the only hard requirement to run the basic downloader. No service, database, or daemon.
- **Optional binaries (yours to install):** `ffmpeg` (or `avconv`) for `--extract-audio` / format merging — needed for most "give me an MP3/MP4" workflows; `rtmpdump` for RTMP streams; `mplayer`/`mpv` for MMS/RTSP.
- **Network:** outbound HTTP(S) to the target sites; optionally a proxy and a cookies file (`--cookies`) for login-gated content.
- **No backend to run:** unlike a service-based downloader, there is nothing to host — it executes and exits.

## Ops difficulty

**Low to run, but high *fragility* to keep working.** Installing and invoking it is trivial: `pip install youtube-dl` (or a downloaded binary), one command, done — no infrastructure. The cost is upstream: because YouTube and other sites change their player and signature logic frequently, an outdated youtube-dl silently starts returning errors or wrong formats, and the slowed release cadence means fixes may lag for weeks or not come at all. The practical ops burden is *staying current* — pinning a version means accepting breakage, and tracking master/nightly or switching to yt-dlp is usually the real maintenance task. For one-off scripts this is fine; for anything long-lived against YouTube, budget for the breakage cycle.

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] ~140.6k GitHub stars as of 2026-06; star counts are date-sensitive and unreliable — indicative only.
- [未验证] Last *tagged* release is 2021.12.17; the master branch reportedly still received commits around 2026-02 (the "nightly"/master builds are what stay current). The gap between tagged and master is the key maintenance signal — verify current master activity before relying on it.
- [推断] yt-dlp being the more-active fork and the de-facto successor for YouTube is the widely-held community position; treat the "default to yt-dlp" recommendation as inference, and re-confirm both projects' activity at decision time.
- [未验证] README-stated Python support (2.6/2.7/3.2+) and the "~1000 sites" figure come from project docs and shift over time; verify against the current repo and `--list-extractors`.
- [未验证] The 2020 GitHub DMCA takedown and subsequent reinstatement are reported history, not re-verified here; check current repo status and any legal context yourself.
- [推断] License is Unlicense (public domain) per the repo; confirm the LICENSE file if license terms are load-bearing for your use.
