## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Mem0** | Use it when your LLM agent must remember users across sessions without bloating the prompt context. | A (5/6) | [→](mem0.md) |
| **Memori** | Use it when you want LLM-agnostic persistent agent memory captured by wrapping your existing client. | B (5/6) | [→](memori.md) |
| **Claude Subconscious** | Use it when you want a background Letta agent to give Claude Code cross-session memory via hooks. | C (6/6) | [→](claude-subconscious.md) |
| **claude-mem** | Use it when your coding agent loses context across sessions and you want local hook/MCP-captured memory compressed and injected back in. | B (6/6) | [→](claude-mem.md) |
| **ByteRover CLI** | Use it when you want a portable, structured memory layer for coding agents with git-like versioning and cloud sync — but it is extremely young (2025-06) and the license is ambiguous. | ? (0/6) | [→](byterover.md) |
| **Letta (MemGPT)** | Platform for stateful agents: AI with advanced memory that can learn and self-improve over time. | ? (0/6) | [→](letta.md) |

| **LangMem** | Use it when you need LangMem for the agent-memory category. | ? (0/6) | [→](langmem.md) |
| **Cognee** | Cognee is the open-source AI memory platform for agents. Give your AI agents persistent long-term memory across sessions with a self-hosted knowledge graph engine. | ? (0/6) | [→](cognee.md) |

| [claude-mem](claude-mem.md) | ✅ | B (6/6) | Hook/MCP memory wired into a coding agent's session lifecycle (not a model-agnostic app memory API); reported star count is unverified. |
| [ByteRover CLI](byterover.md) | ✅ | ? (0/6) | Portable structured memory for coding agents with git-like versioning and cloud sync; extremely young (2025-06) and license ambiguity (NOASSERTION vs Elastic 2.0). |

## What belongs here

Infrastructure whose primary job is to **store and recall** agent memory across sessions, independent of the model. Not task/issue tracking (see `agent-tooling`), not RAG document retrieval (see `rag-retrieval`).
