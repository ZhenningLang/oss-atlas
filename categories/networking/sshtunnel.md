# sshtunnel

A small Python library (and CLI) that wraps Paramiko to give you SSH port-forwarding tunnels as a context manager — `with SSHTunnelForwarder(...) as t:` opens a local port that bridges, through an SSH bastion, to a service you can't reach directly.

![sshtunnel — health radar](../../assets/health/sshtunnel.svg)

## When to use

You're writing a Python script that needs to talk to a Postgres (or Redis, or an internal HTTP API) that lives inside a private network, reachable only by SSH through a bastion host. Doing this by hand means spawning `ssh -L 5432:db.internal:5432 bastion` in a subprocess and racing to know when the tunnel is up. Instead you wrap it: `with SSHTunnelForwarder(('bastion', 22), ssh_username=..., remote_bind_address=('db.internal', 5432)) as tunnel:` and then point your DB client at `127.0.0.1:tunnel.local_bind_port`. The tunnel opens on `__enter__`, tears down on `__exit__`, and you get the bound local port programmatically — no subprocess parsing, no leaked `ssh` processes, all inside your Python process and exception handling. It's the clean way to script "reach a private service via a jump host" without reimplementing port forwarding on Paramiko yourself.

It shines for throwaway automation and data scripts: a one-off migration that must hit a DB behind a bastion, a notebook pulling from an internal service, or a small daemon that needs a persistent forwarded port with start/stop control.

## When NOT to use

- **Production-grade, long-lived, high-throughput tunnels.** It's a convenience wrapper over Paramiko's (pure-Python, threaded) forwarding — fine for scripts, but for durable production tunneling, native `ssh -L`/`autossh`, or a real SSH-config-managed setup is more robust and faster.
- **You need OpenSSH config fidelity.** It won't honor your full `~/.ssh/config` (ProxyJump chains, match blocks, every option) the way the OpenSSH client does; complex multi-hop setups are easier with native `ssh`.
- **You already use Paramiko directly.** If your code is already managing a Paramiko `Transport`, adding `sshtunnel` is another layer for something Paramiko can do via `Transport.open_channel('direct-tcpip', ...)` — weigh the dependency.
- **You want active, current maintenance.** The last release is **0.4.0 (Jan 2021)**; the repo still gets occasional commits (last push 2025-08) but the cadence is slow — pin it and test against your Python/Paramiko versions. [未验证]
- **Reverse tunnels / SOCKS proxying as a primary need.** Its sweet spot is local→remote forwarding through a bastion; for general SOCKS or heavy reverse-forwarding, reach for purpose-built tooling.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Our verdict | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Paramiko](paramiko.md) | ✅ | Use this page for its stated niche; choose Paramiko when you need the engine sshtunnel wraps. | The engine sshtunnel wraps — full SSH/SFTP/transport control, but you implement the forwarding/context-manager ergonomics yourself. |
| native `ssh -L` / `autossh` | 未收录 | Use this page for its stated niche; choose native ssh -L / autossh when you need openSSH client (optionally auto-reconnecting). | OpenSSH client (optionally auto-reconnecting) — robust, fast, full config fidelity, but it's a subprocess to manage, not an in-Python object. |
| `subprocess` + `ssh` | 未收录 | Use this page for its stated niche; choose subprocess + ssh when you need zero extra deps, but you parse text and manage the child process / readiness yourself. | Zero extra deps, but you parse text and manage the child process / readiness yourself. |
| AsyncSSH (forwarding API) | 未收录 | Use this page for its stated niche; choose AsyncSSH (forwarding API) when you need asyncio-native SSH with its own forwarding. | asyncio-native SSH with its own forwarding; better for async codebases, different API, heavier than a thin wrapper. |

## Tech stack

- **Language:** pure Python.
- **Core dependency:** **Paramiko** does the actual SSH transport and channel forwarding; sshtunnel adds the `SSHTunnelForwarder` object, threading, lifecycle, and a CLI.
- **API surface:** a context-manager / start-stop object exposing the bound local address/port, plus a `sshtunnel` command-line entry point.
- **Concurrency:** threaded, following Paramiko's blocking model — one (or more) forwarded channels managed by background threads.

## Dependencies

- **Runtime:** Python 3 and **Paramiko** (which in turn pulls in `cryptography`/OpenSSL). [推断]
- **External:** an SSH server / bastion you can authenticate to, and the target service reachable from that bastion — sshtunnel runs nothing of its own server-side.
- **Install:** `pip install sshtunnel`.

## Ops difficulty

**Low (as a library).** Nothing to deploy — `pip install` and use the context manager. The operational care is around reliability and auth: tunnels can drop on network blips (no built-in reconnection like `autossh`), so long-lived use needs your own keepalive/retry; credentials/keys must be handled safely; and because it sits on Paramiko, you inherit Paramiko's host-key policy and version-pinning concerns. For short scripts it's nearly zero-ops; for anything persistent, plan for reconnection and monitoring yourself.

## Health & viability

- **Maintenance (2026-06).** Last tagged release **0.4.0 (Jan 2021)**; repo last pushed 2025-08 — **low activity / coasting** but not archived. Mature and small enough that "done" is plausible, but don't expect rapid fixes. [未验证]
- **Governance / bus factor.** Owned by an individual (**pahaz**, ~271 commits) with one substantial co-contributor (fernandezcuesta, ~142) — a **thin bus factor**; it's a single-author utility library. [推断]
- **Age & Lindy verdict.** Created **2014**, ~12 years old; the wrapper is thin and stable, so age + a small stable API is a *moderate* Lindy signal — but its health is really tied to **Paramiko's** continued maintenance underneath. [推断]
- **Adoption.** ~1.3k stars and broad use in data/automation scripts where a quick bastion tunnel is needed; widely referenced in tutorials for "connect to DB behind a jump host from Python." [未验证]
- **Risk flags.** MIT, no relicense history. Main risks: slow maintenance cadence and full dependence on Paramiko (its security advisories and version drift propagate here). [推断]

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] ~1.3k stars / ~202 forks / ~81 open issues as of 2026-06 — date-sensitive, indicative only.
- [未验证] Last release 0.4.0 dated Jan 2021; whether newer fixes ship only as unreleased commits is not confirmed — check the repo before pinning.
- [推断] Exact transitive deps (Paramiko → cryptography, etc.) depend on the installed Paramiko version.
- [未验证] Behavior with complex multi-hop / ProxyJump setups and full `~/.ssh/config` parity is not verified — native `ssh` is the safer bet there.
- [推断] No built-in auto-reconnect; persistent-tunnel reliability depends on your own retry layer (inference from its scope as a thin wrapper).
