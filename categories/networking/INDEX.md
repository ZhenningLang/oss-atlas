## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Paramiko** | Use it when Python code must open SSH/SFTP connections and run remote commands programmatically — but it's pure-Python (slower than OpenSSH), threading-only, and LGPL-2.1. | B (6/6) | [→](paramiko.md) |
| **sshtunnel** | Use it when a Python script needs a clean context-managed SSH port-forward to a service behind a bastion — but it has no auto-reconnect and is low-activity (0.4.0, 2021). | B (5/6) | [→](sshtunnel.md) |
| **dnspython** | Use it when Python needs arbitrary record types, custom resolvers, zone transfers, DNSSEC, or DoH/DoT — but it bypasses /etc/hosts and the OS resolver, requires Python 3.10+, and is a library not a CLI. | B (5/6) | [→](dnspython.md) |
| **wondershaper** | Use it when one Linux NIC needs a quick up/down bandwidth ceiling without hand-writing tc rules — but it's HTB-era (not bufferbloat-aware like cake/fq_codel) and Linux-only, coasting since 2024-07. | D (4/6) | [→](wondershaper.md) |
| **ThriftPy** | Use it only to understand a legacy service still importing thriftpy before migrating — the repo is archived and deprecated, so all new Thrift work should go to the maintained thriftpy2. | D (5/6) | [→](thriftpy.md) |
