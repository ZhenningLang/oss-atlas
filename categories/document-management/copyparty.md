# copyparty

A single-file, zero-required-dependency portable file server with accelerated resumable uploads, dedup, and a media indexer — reachable over HTTP, WebDAV, FTP/FTPS, SFTP, TFTP, and SMB.

## When to use

You're the homelab person for a small team, and you keep needing a place to *drop files* — share a folder of scans with a colleague, let a non-technical client upload a 4 GB video that has to survive a flaky connection, expose an archive over WebDAV so a phone can browse it, and have FTP/SFTP available for the one legacy device that only speaks FTP. Spinning up a full DMS or an S3 stack for this is overkill, and you don't want to install a database and three services just to move bytes around. You copy one file — `copyparty-sfx.py` (or run the Docker image) — point it at a directory, define a couple of per-volume read/write users, and you have a browser-accessible server with a real upload UI, resumable multithreaded uploads (`up2k`/`u2c`) that shrug off dropped connections, and content-matching dedup so re-uploads don't bloat the disk. The built-in indexer makes the tree searchable by name, path, date, size, and audio tags, and renders thumbnails for images/video/audio — so for a pile of media and loose files it's "stand it up and forget it," with no Postgres, no Redis, no Angular build.

It also shines as the *ingest and transport* layer in front of something heavier: copyparty's event hooks and file-parser plugins can fire a program on each upload (move it, transcode it, or hand it to a real DMS), so you can use it as the friendly upload front door while a downstream system does OCR and archival.

## When NOT to use

- **You actually need a document-management system (OCR + full-text content search).** copyparty searches *filenames, paths, dates, sizes, and audio (ID3) tags* — it does **not** OCR scanned paperwork and does **not** full-text-index document *contents*. For "find the invoice that mentions account 1234," use [paperless-ngx](paperless-ngx.md) or [Twake Drive](twake-drive.md), not copyparty.
- **You want collaborative document editing / Office co-authoring.** It serves and (for Markdown) lightly edits files; it is not a Drive/Office-suite replacement.
- **You want a hardened internet-facing service by default.** It's powerful and exposes many protocols; the SMB server is explicitly labeled unsafe/slow and "not recommended for wan," and a broad protocol surface on the public internet wants a reverse proxy, TLS, and care. It is not a turnkey secure cloud.
- **You need folder *sync* (two-way, Dropbox-style).** The maintainer states full sync will never be supported — it's upload/download/serve, not a sync engine.
- **You need lifecycle/retention, approvals, e-signatures, versioning, or audit trails.** None of that is the goal; the project's stated philosophy is "do all the things, and do an *okay* job," prioritizing breadth over depth.
- **You need fine-grained, per-document multi-tenant privacy.** Permissions are per-volume / per-user (read/write/move/delete/admin/dotfiles), not per-document ACLs.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| [paperless-ngx](paperless-ngx.md) | ✅ | A real DMS: OCR + full-text content search + auto-tagging of scanned paperwork, but a multi-container Django/Postgres/Redis stack. copyparty has zero of that OCR/FTS pipeline; it's a far lighter file server, not a document archive. |
| [Twake Drive](twake-drive.md) | ✅ | Collaborative drive with document editing, sharing, and a richer permission model; heavier to run. copyparty is single-file file-transfer/serving with no co-editing or per-document ACLs. |
| Nextcloud | 未收录 | Full self-hosted "cloud" (files, sync clients, apps, sharing, optional OCR via add-ons) but a heavy PHP/DB/Redis stack. copyparty is dramatically lighter and faster to stand up, with no two-way sync and no app ecosystem. |
| Seafile | 未收录 | Block-based sync-and-share with strong delta sync and client apps. copyparty wins on portability/zero-deps and protocol breadth (WebDAV/FTP/SFTP/TFTP/SMB) but has no real sync. |
| Filebrowser | 未收录 | Comparable lightweight single-binary web file manager (Go). Narrower protocol set and no `up2k`-style resumable accelerated uploads or media indexer; simpler to reason about. |
| MinIO | 未收录 | S3-compatible object storage for programmatic/app access. Different shape entirely — copyparty is a human-facing multi-protocol file server, not an object store. |

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Python (server). Browser UI is vanilla JS/HTML/CSS (`up2k` client-side uploader).
- **Storage/index:** plain filesystem; a per-volume SQLite database (`.hist/up2k.db`) for the file index / dedup / tags.
- **Protocols:** HTTP(S), WebDAV, FTP(S), SFTP, TFTP, SMB/CIFS; zeroconf (mDNS/SSDP) discovery.
- **Optional accelerators:** Pillow / pyvips / FFmpeg (thumbnails + transcode), Mutagen / FFprobe (audio tags), libraw/rawpy (RAW thumbnails). All optional — the core server runs on Python alone.
- **Extensibility:** event hooks and file-parser plugins (run external programs on upload to add tags or trigger downstream processing).

## Dependencies

- **Required:** just a Python interpreter. The project states "server only needs Python (2 or 3), all dependencies optional." Modern Python 3 recommended; legacy Python 2 reportedly still runs `[未验证]`.
- **Optional (feature-gated):** Pillow / pyvips / FFmpeg for thumbnails & media transcoding; Mutagen for audio metadata; pyvips/libvips, rawpy/libraw for extra image formats.
- **Deployment artifacts:** `copyparty-sfx.py` (single self-contained file), Windows `copyparty.exe`, official Docker images, and packages on Arch / Homebrew / NixOS.
- **Infra:** no external database, message broker, or other service required — it is genuinely self-contained.

## Ops difficulty

**Low** for the common case: copy one file (or `docker run`), pass a few flags or a small config to define volumes and users, and it's up — no DB to provision, no migrations, no extra services. Difficulty rises to **low-to-medium** when you (a) enable the optional media/thumbnail/transcode stack (now you're managing FFmpeg/Pillow versions), or (b) expose it to the internet, where the broad protocol surface (WebDAV/FTP/SFTP/TFTP/SMB) means you own TLS, a reverse proxy, real-IP handling, and locking down the riskier protocols (SMB is flagged unsafe for WAN). You own backups of the served directories and the `.hist` index.

## Health & viability

- **Maintenance (2026-06).** Frequent releases (v1.20.16, 2026-05-26) and last pushed 2026-06 — **active**, fast-moving, not archived. [推断]
- **Governance / bus factor.** This is the standout flag: a **single-maintainer, `User`-owned repo** (`9001/copyparty`) with ~45k stars. Heavy adoption resting on one person is a real bus-factor risk — if the maintainer steps away, there is no foundation or vendor to carry it. The opinionated, single-author design (e.g. "sync will never be supported") is the flip side of that. [推断]
- **Age & Lindy verdict.** ~7 years old (created 2019-05) and still actively maintained ⇒ a **moderate Lindy** signal — long enough to have proven durable, but it lives or dies with its maintainer rather than an institution. [推断]
- **Adoption.** Strong for its niche (45k stars, packaged on Arch/Homebrew/NixOS, official Docker), which is exactly what makes the bus-factor concentration matter. [未验证]
- **Risk flags.** MIT, no relicense or open-core found; the broad protocol surface (SMB flagged unsafe for WAN) is a *security* concern when internet-facing, separate from project viability. [推断]

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] Star count ~45.4k from a single `gh repo view` fetch (2026-06-26); GitHub stars are unreliable and date-sensitive — treat as indicative only.
- [未验证] Latest release v1.20.16 ("s6-ready") published 2026-05-26 per the GitHub API this session; repo last pushed 2026-06-16. Not archived, actively maintained.
- [推断] "Single-file / zero required dependencies" reflects the project's own framing (`copyparty-sfx.py` + "all dependencies optional"); the exact minimum Python 3 version for the current release was not pinned in the fetched docs — verify against the running release before relying on a specific interpreter version.
- [未验证] Search is filename/path/date/size + audio-tag based; no OCR and no document full-text-content indexing were found in the README — confirm against current docs if content search is a hard requirement.
- [未验证] File-parser plugins / event hooks can run external programs to add custom tags or trigger downstream processing, but the breadth of out-of-the-box (non-audio) media tagging — e.g. EXIF, video resolution — was not clearly enumerated in the fetched docs.
