# Radix UI Primitives

Radix Primitives is an open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps. Maintained by @workos.

![Radix UI Primitives — health radar](../../assets/health/radix-ui.svg)

## When to use

You're choosing open-source infrastructure for a task that falls into `web-ui` and you need a real repository to evaluate, not just a product name from a comparison table. You reach for Radix UI Primitives when its upstream description matches the job and when adopting an existing project is preferable to writing custom glue from scratch.

This first-pass page exists because Radix UI Primitives was repeatedly useful as a comparison candidate in the atlas backlog. Use it as an intake-backed starting point: verify the upstream README and license, then compare it against the linked neighboring pages before committing to the dependency.

## When NOT to use

- **You need a fully reviewed, deeply researched atlas page today.** Use a more mature in-index page from the comparison table until this intake page has been semantically reviewed with the upstream docs.
- **The GitHub metadata flags a blocker for your environment.** If license, archival status, or maintenance cadence is load-bearing, choose a better-verified alternative in this category instead of relying on Radix UI Primitives.
- **Your task needs a narrower or more specialized substitute.** Prefer the existing page whose `When NOT to use` section names your exact constraint; this page is a broad first-pass entry.
- **You cannot afford upstream churn or operational unknowns.** Pick an older in-index project with a clearer Lindy record and documented ops profile.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Our verdict | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Angular](angular.md) | ✅ | When you need the established in-index option for this category, compare it against Radix UI Primitives before switching. | Radix UI Primitives is newly indexed from the intake backlog; use the existing page when its documented constraints match better, and choose Radix UI Primitives only after verifying the repo-specific caveats below. |
| [Ant Design](ant-design.md) | ✅ | When you need the established in-index option for this category, compare it against Radix UI Primitives before switching. | Radix UI Primitives is newly indexed from the intake backlog; use the existing page when its documented constraints match better, and choose Radix UI Primitives only after verifying the repo-specific caveats below. |
| [Chakra UI](chakra-ui.md) | ✅ | When you need the established in-index option for this category, compare it against Radix UI Primitives before switching. | Radix UI Primitives is newly indexed from the intake backlog; use the existing page when its documented constraints match better, and choose Radix UI Primitives only after verifying the repo-specific caveats below. |
| [Driver.js](driver-js.md) | ✅ | When you need the established in-index option for this category, compare it against Radix UI Primitives before switching. | Radix UI Primitives is newly indexed from the intake backlog; use the existing page when its documented constraints match better, and choose Radix UI Primitives only after verifying the repo-specific caveats below. |
| Hand-rolled integration | 未收录 | Choose custom code only when the needed scope is tiny and the maintenance burden is clearly lower than adopting this repo. | Custom code avoids a dependency but loses the upstream project, ecosystem, and documented tradeoffs captured here. |

## Tech stack

- **Primary language:** TypeScript per GitHub metadata.
- **Repository:** `radix-ui/primitives`.
- **Project shape:** categorized as `library` for atlas routing; verify upstream architecture before treating this as a stable API contract.
- **Upstream state:** default branch `main`, last pushed `2026-07-03T16:43:19Z`, archived `false`.

## Dependencies

- **Runtime dependencies:** not exhaustively verified in this intake pass; inspect the upstream dependency manifest before production use.
- **External services:** not exhaustively verified in this intake pass; check whether the project requires databases, queues, cloud APIs, browser runtimes, GPUs, or model-provider credentials.
- **Operational input:** at minimum, you depend on the GitHub repository and its release/update process.

## Ops difficulty

**Unknown to medium until the upstream docs are reread.** Library-style entries may be low effort to try but still need version pinning and upgrade review. App/service/framework entries can carry hidden database, worker, storage, auth, browser, GPU, or cloud-provider requirements, so treat this first-pass entry as an intake marker rather than an ops runbook.

## Health & viability

- **Maintenance snapshot:** GitHub reports `archived=false` and `pushed_at=2026-07-03T16:43:19Z` as of 2026-07-06.
- **Adoption snapshot:** ~19,028 GitHub stars as of 2026-07; stars are only a noisy adoption signal.
- **License snapshot:** `MIT` from GitHub API; inspect repository license files when the license matters.
- **Lindy and governance:** not fully reviewed in this intake pass. Treat org ownership, project age, release cadence, and bus factor as open review items before long-term adoption.
- **Risk flags:** first-pass page generated from backlog metadata.

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] This is a first-pass intake page generated from GitHub metadata and the 2026-07-06 backlog; before relying on it for a high-stakes selection, reread the upstream README, docs, license file, and release notes.
- [推断] The comparison table uses nearby in-index pages as a starting point; a later semantic review should replace generic neighboring rows with the closest true substitutes.
