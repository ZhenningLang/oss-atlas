## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **LiteRT-LM** | Use it when you want to run Gemma-class LLMs on phone/laptop/edge via Google's LiteRT runtime (CPU/GPU/NPU). | B (6/6) | [→](litert-lm.md) |
| **BitNet** | Use it when you need fast, low-energy CPU inference of natively-trained 1.58-bit ternary LLMs on x86/ARM laptops, offline. | C (6/6) | [→](bitnet.md) |
| **Google AI Edge Gallery** | Use it when you need to demo and benchmark on-device Gemma LLMs on real phones before building. | A (5/6) | [→](ai-edge-gallery.md) |
| **TimesFM** | Use it when you need zero-shot time-series forecasts run locally on CPU/GPU without per-dataset training. | B (5/6) | [→](timesfm.md) |
| **MiniCPM-V** | Use it when you need efficient on-device/edge multimodal (image+video) understanding with a small footprint — verify the per-weight license. | A (4/6) | [→](minicpm-v.md) |
| **Stable Diffusion WebUI** | Use it when you want a local web-based GUI for Stable Diffusion image generation, editing, and upscaling on your own GPU — but it requires technical setup and an NVIDIA GPU. | ? (0/6) | [→](stable-diffusion-webui.md) |
| **ComfyUI** | Use it when you want a modular node-graph interface for building complex diffusion-model workflows locally — but it has a steep learning curve and requires significant GPU resources. | ? (0/6) | [→](comfyui.md) |

## What belongs here

Runtimes and models meant to **run inference locally / on-device** — phone, laptop, edge, CPU. Not cloud training (see `llm-training`), not RAG retrieval (see `rag-retrieval`).
