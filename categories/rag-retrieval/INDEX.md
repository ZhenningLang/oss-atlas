## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FalkorDB** | Use it when GraphRAG needs vector similarity plus multi-hop graph traversal in one low-latency Redis-embedded engine. | D (5/6) | [→](falkordb.md) |
| **graphify** | Use it when an agent needs to query a whole repo's code, schemas and docs as a knowledge graph instead of grepping. | B (6/6) | [→](graphify.md) |
| **code-review-graph** | Use it when an AI reviewer keeps burning context on a large repo and you want only the blast-radius files. | B (6/6) | [→](code-review-graph.md) |
| **PageIndex** | Use it when vector RAG returns similar-but-irrelevant chunks over a few long, structured documents needing auditable citations. | B (5/6) | [→](pageindex.md) |
| **Understand-Anything** | Use it when you want any codebase turned into an explorable, queryable knowledge graph for an agent — younger and less proven than graphify. | B (6/6) | [→](understand-anything.md) |
| **FAISS** | Use it when you need a fast in-process ANN vector index for embeddings — a library, not a managed vector DB. | A (6/6) | [→](faiss.md) |
| **text2vec** | Use it when you need Chinese-first sentence embeddings for semantic search or FAQ matching from a single pip install — it's only the encoder, so bring your own vector index (FAISS/Milvus). | C (5/6) | [→](text2vec.md) |

## What belongs here

Infrastructure whose primary job is **indexing and retrieving** context for RAG — document indexes, code graphs, graph databases. Not agent memory (see `agent-memory`), not research agents (see `deep-research`).
