## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Authomatic** | Use it when a framework-agnostic Python app needs thin "sign in with X" via OAuth1/OAuth2/OpenID, leaving session persistence to you — but it's low-velocity and an auth lib's slow fix cadence is a security risk. | C (5/6) | [→](authomatic.md) |
| **django-rules** | Use it when Django object-level permissions are computed from logic (predicates), not stored grants, with no DB tables — but if admins must assign per-object permissions at runtime you need django-guardian instead. | B (5/6) | [→](django-rules.md) |
