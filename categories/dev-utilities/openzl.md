# OpenZL

A format-aware compression framework from Meta: you describe the shape of your structured data and it builds a specialized compressor whose output a single universal decompressor can always read.

## When to use

You're a data-platform or storage engineer sitting on terabytes of one specific, highly structured payload — fixed-schema telemetry records, columnar feature dumps for an AI training pipeline, arrays of sorted integers, multi-field binary logs. A generic byte-stream compressor (zstd, lz4) treats the whole blob as an opaque sequence and leaves a lot of ratio on the table because it never sees that column 3 is a monotonic timestamp and column 7 is a low-cardinality enum. You've tried hand-rolling a transpose-then-delta-then-zstd pipeline and it works, but it's bespoke per dataset and a pain to maintain. OpenZL lets you instead *describe* the data — via a pre-built profile, the SDDL (Simple Data Description Language), or a custom parser — and it composes primitive codecs into a DAG that splits your records into homogeneous streams (parse → group → transform & compress), applying delta/transpose/dictionary steps where they actually pay off.

The payoff is two-fold: you can get materially better ratio-at-speed than a generic compressor on that specific format, and every frame you produce is readable by OpenZL's single universal decompressor regardless of which graph created it — so consumers don't need to know which specialized compressor was used. Meta states the core has "reached production-readiness" and is "used extensively in production at Meta", which is reassuring if you're considering it for a real ingestion pipeline rather than a one-off.

## When NOT to use

- **Generic / unstructured / text blobs.** OpenZL's leverage comes from format awareness over homogeneous streams (numeric, columnar, tabular). For arbitrary text, source code, mixed web payloads, or "just compress this file", a general-purpose compressor like zstd or brotli is simpler and likely as good — the docs themselves make no generic/text performance claims. [推断]
- **You need format stability TODAY.** The project is explicit: "The API, the compressed format, and the set of codecs and graphs included in OpenZL are all subject to (and will!) change." Only release-tagged commits carry the multi-year decompressibility guarantee; `dev` branch offers "no guarantees whatsoever." Pre-1.0.
- **Small payloads / one-off files.** The describe-the-data + build-a-specialized-compressor workflow has real upfront modeling cost. For a handful of small or heterogeneous files it's overkill versus `zstd -19`.
- **You want a drop-in CLI to replace `gzip`/`zstd`.** This is a framework + library you compose against and a format you adopt, not a transparent stand-in for an existing compressor in your shell pipeline.
- **Non-C/C++ shops wanting zero native build.** It's a C11/C++17 codebase built with CMake/Make; you take on a native toolchain and the maintenance of a format that is still evolving (lock-in to OpenZL's frame format until it stabilizes).
- **Windows-first teams.** Build guidance recommends clang-cl; MSVC "may produce C2099 errors due to limited C11 support."

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| [CyberChef](cyberchef.md) | ✅ | Browser-based ad-hoc encode/decode/compress recipes for analysts; interactive and general, not a production library for ratio-tuned structured-data compression. |
| [DevToys](devtoys.md) | ✅ | Desktop developer-utility hub with built-in compress/format tools; convenience for one-off tasks, not a programmable format-aware compressor. |
| zstd | 未收录 | The general-purpose baseline (also Meta/BSD). Excellent ratio-at-speed on arbitrary bytes; OpenZL targets *beating* it on specific structured formats via format awareness, at the cost of having to describe the data. |
| Parquet + zstd/snappy | 未收录 | The mainstream columnar-at-rest path: schema-aware encodings (dictionary/RLE) plus a block codec. Mature and ubiquitous; OpenZL is a lower-level framework letting you build custom codec graphs, not a file format with an ecosystem. |
| BLOSC / blosc2 | 未收录 | Blocking + shuffle/bitshuffle meta-compressor aimed at numeric arrays; conceptually similar "transform then compress" idea, narrower scope and more mature than OpenZL. |
| Brotli | 未收录 | Strong general-purpose (esp. text/web) compressor; not format-aware for structured numeric data. |

## Tech stack

- **Language:** C (~51%) and C++ (~44.7%) per the repo.
- **Core model:** codecs composed into a directed acyclic graph (DAG); a single universal decompressor that "can decompress anything produced by the compressor, independent of the compression DAG."
- **Data description:** pre-built profiles for known formats, SDDL (Simple Data Description Language), pre-parsed homogeneous streams, or custom parsers.
- **Tooling:** core library plus a CLI (`cli/`), example transforms/parsers, benchmark and test harnesses; Python bindings present (`py/`). [推断] scope of Python bindings unverified beyond directory presence.
- **Build:** CMake (≥ 3.20.2) or Make; requires a C11 + C++17 compiler.

## Dependencies

- **Toolchain:** a compiler supporting C11 and C++17 (GCC/Clang; clang-cl recommended on Windows). CMake ≥ 3.20.2 if using the CMake path.
- **Vendored deps:** the repo carries a `deps/` directory and submodules (`.gitmodules`); the build pulls its own dependencies rather than requiring a heavy external runtime. [推断] exact dependency set not enumerated here.
- **Runtime:** no server/daemon/database — it's an embeddable compression library + CLI, not a service.
- **Install:** build from source (`make`, or `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..`); no published package manager artifact verified.

## Ops difficulty

**Low-to-medium as a library; medium as a format commitment.** Operationally there's nothing to run — no service, no DB; you link the library or invoke the CLI. The "low" friction is offset by two real costs: (1) a native C11/C++17 build you must own (CMake/Make, and clang-cl gymnastics on Windows), and (2) the *format-evolution* burden — because the compressed format is still changing pre-1.0, you must pin to release-tagged versions and plan for re-compression / version skew over time, even though release frames stay decompressible "for at least the next several years." The upfront data-modeling effort (writing SDDL / choosing a graph) is a per-dataset design task, not a deploy task.

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] License is BSD; the LICENSE file carries three conditions including the non-endorsement clause, so SPDX `BSD-3-Clause` (Meta's standard license, same family as zstd) — frontmatter reflects this inference, not an SPDX tag declared in-repo (`gh` reports the license as "Other/NOASSERTION").
- [未验证] Latest release v0.2.0 dated 2026-05-07; first public release v0.1.0 on 2025-10-06 (alongside the engineering blog post and whitepaper arXiv:2510.03203). Star count ~3.1k as of 2026-06 — GitHub stars are unreliable and date-sensitive; treat as indicative only.
- [未验证] Language percentages (C ~51% / C++ ~44.7%) are GitHub's linguist estimate and shift over time.
- [推断] "Better ratio than generic compressors on structured data" is the project's framing; no first-party head-to-head benchmark numbers are quoted here — actual gains depend heavily on the dataset and the codec graph you build.
- [推断] Python bindings exist (`py/` directory) but their completeness/stability was not verified.
- [推断] Suitability for text/generic data is judged poor because the docs only demonstrate structured/numeric examples and make no generic-data claims — not an explicit "do not use" statement from the authors.
