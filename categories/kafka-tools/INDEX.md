## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Page |
|---|---|---|
| **UI for Apache Kafka (provectus/kafka-ui)** | Use it when you want a one-`docker run` web dashboard to browse Kafka brokers, topics, and consumer-group lag — but this `provectus` upstream is stalled (last release 2024-04); deploy the maintained `kafbat/kafka-ui` fork instead. | [→](kafka-ui.md) |
| **kafka-python** | Use it when you want a pure-Python Kafka client that just `pip install`s with no librdkafka to compile — but a pure-Python client can't match `confluent-kafka`'s throughput and may trail the newest broker features. | [→](kafka-python.md) |
