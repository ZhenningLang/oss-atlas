# CC Switch

A cross-platform desktop All-in-One manager for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and Hermes Agent — built with Rust and Tauri 2.

![CC Switch — health radar](../../assets/health/cc-switch.svg)

## When to use

You're a developer who juggles multiple AI coding agents and assistants across your daily workflow. You switch between Claude Code for deep codebase work, Codex for quick tasks, Gemini CLI for Google-integrated queries, and OpenClaw for personal messaging. You pick CC Switch over managing each tool from its own terminal window because it provides a single desktop control plane that unifies credentials, settings, and model providers with visual provider routing, skill management, and MCP integration. You pick it over a terminal-based workflow when you want to switch agents without memorizing CLI flags or maintaining separate config files for each tool. You install CC Switch, connect your providers once, and manage all your AI tools from one cross-platform GUI instead of context-switching across disparate interfaces.

## When NOT to use

- **If you only use one agent** — use that agent directly (e.g., Claude Code CLI) instead of CC Switch, because CC Switch adds unnecessary GUI overhead and abstraction for a single tool.
- **If you need to run on a headless server or CI pipeline** — use the CLI agents directly via SSH or shell scripts instead of CC Switch, because CC Switch is a Tauri desktop app that requires a GUI environment and will not run in headless environments.
- **If you need team-wide RBAC, audit trails, or policy enforcement** — use a governed platform like [Dify](https://github.com/langgenius/dify) or [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) instead of CC Switch, because CC Switch has no RBAC, admin layer, or enterprise compliance features.
- **If you don't switch between LLM providers or manage custom skills/MCP servers** — use a single agent like Claude Code or Gemini CLI directly instead of CC Switch, because if you don't need provider management, the added abstraction provides no value.
- **If you prefer staying entirely in the terminal** — use a terminal multiplexer like tmux or a shell alias system instead of CC Switch, because CC Switch is a GUI overlay built on Tauri, not a terminal-native solution.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Our verdict | Tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [OpenClaw](openclaw.md) | ✅ | Personal multi-channel AI assistant. | OpenClaw is a self-hosted assistant across messaging apps; CC Switch is a desktop manager for coding agents, not a conversational bot. |
| [Hermes Agent](hermes-agent.md) | ✅ | Self-improving AI agent with a learning loop. | Hermes Agent is an autonomous agent; CC Switch is a management layer for other agents, not an agent itself. |
| [OpenCode](opencode.md) | ✅ | Open-source terminal coding agent. | OpenCode is one of the tools CC Switch manages; they complement rather than compete. |
| Claude Code / Claude Desktop | 未收录 | Official Anthropic desktop IDE integration. | First-party, closed-source; CC Switch adds multi-provider unification but at the cost of a third-party abstraction layer. |
| Cursor / Windsurf | 未收录 | AI-native IDEs with built-in multi-model support. | These are full editors with agent features; CC Switch is a meta-manager, not a code editor. |

## Tech stack

- **Rust** — core backend logic and Tauri 2 integration
- **TypeScript** — frontend UI layer
- **Tauri 2** — cross-platform desktop application framework
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — for connecting custom skills and integrations

## Dependencies

- A supported desktop OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- The AI tools you want to manage (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, etc.) installed separately
- API keys / credentials for each LLM provider you configure
- System webview (provided by the OS; Tauri 2 uses the native webview engine)

## Ops difficulty

**Low**. CC Switch is a desktop GUI application distributed via standard installer packages. The operational burden is limited to configuring your agent credentials and keeping the app updated. There is no server or database to maintain. However, you must still manage each underlying agent's credentials and updates independently.

## Health & viability
- **Maintenance**: Grade A — 13/13 active weeks in trailing 13; last commit 1 day ago.
- **Responsiveness**: Cannot be scored — no_traffic.
- **Adoption**: Cannot be scored — unknown.
- **Longevity**: Grade D — 333 days old.
- **Governance**: Grade D — top-3 contributor share 91.5% (?).
- **Risk / License**: Grade A — MIT license.
## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] The `111.6k` star count on a repo created in 2025-08 may be inflated by hype or bot activity rather than organic adoption.
- [未验证] `farion1231` is a personal GitHub account; there may be no team or backup maintainers.
- [未验证] The "official website" claim (`ccswitch.io`) has not been verified for authenticity or ongoing operation.
- [推断] As a meta-manager, CC Switch's value depends on the continued compatibility of the agents it manages; upstream API changes could break integrations quickly.
