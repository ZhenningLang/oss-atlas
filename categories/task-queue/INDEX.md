## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **XXL-JOB** | Use it when a Java/Spring shop needs centrally-managed, visual, sharded scheduled jobs — mind GPL-3.0 and the central-scheduler SPOF. | B (5/6) | [→](xxl-job.md) |
| **Celery** | Use it when a Python app must offload async/background jobs at scale — at the cost of running a broker + workers. | B (5/6) | [→](celery.md) |
| **Kombu** | Use it when a Python service must publish/consume messages across swappable brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis, SQS) — virtual transports emulate AMQP imperfectly, so "swap the URL" is not identical behavior. | B (6/6) | [→](kombu.md) |
| **Flower** | Use it when a production Celery cluster needs a live dashboard to inspect and control workers and export Prometheus metrics — it can revoke tasks, so never expose it unauthenticated. | B (4/6) | [→](flower.md) |

## What belongs here

Systems whose primary job is **distributed background job execution** — task queues and job schedulers. Not workflow/DAG orchestrators (see `workflow-orchestration`), not agent runtimes (see `agent-frameworks`).
