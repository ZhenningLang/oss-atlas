## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Grafana** | Use it when you need one dashboard + alerting layer over Prometheus/Loki/Elasticsearch and other sources — it visualizes, it doesn't store. | B (5/6) | [→](grafana.md) |

## Comparison matrix

| Option | Indexed | Health | One-line tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Grafana](grafana.md) | ✅ | B (5/6) | Unified dashboard/alerting over many datasources; a visualization layer, not a datastore (AGPL-3.0). |
| [Telegraf](../dev-utilities/telegraf.md) | ✅ | A (5/6) | Plugin-driven collection/routing agent that feeds the backends Grafana reads — different job. |
| Kibana / Datadog / Apache Superset | 未收录 | — | Other dashboard/observability/BI stacks named across the pages. |

## What belongs here

Tools whose primary job is **visualizing and alerting** on metrics/logs/traces from datasources you already run. Not collection agents (see `dev-utilities` → Telegraf), not SQL/BI analytics (see `data-visualization`).
