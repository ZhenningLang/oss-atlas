## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **beads** | Use it when an AI agent loses task state across sessions and you want a versioned, dependency-aware task graph in the repo. | B (6/6) | [→](beads.md) |
| **CCPM** | Use it when a feature is too big for one session and you want PRD-to-GitHub-Issues specs plus parallel git-worktree agents. | B (4/6) | [→](ccpm.md) |
| **Entire** | Use it when you want AI agent sessions captured as Git checkpoints alongside commits, searchable and rewindable. | B (5/6) | [→](entire-cli.md) |
| **Ralph for Claude Code** | Use it when you want Claude Code to grind through a fix_plan.md checklist unattended with rate limits, a circuit breaker, and a dual-condition exit gate. | B (6/6) | [→](ralph-claude-code.md) |
| **Context Mode** | Use it when a coding agent burns context on raw tool output and you want sandboxed execution plus compaction-surviving session memory. | D (6/6) | [→](context-mode.md) |
| **Planning with Files** | Use it when a long agent run keeps losing its plan to /clear, compaction, or crashes. | B (4/6) | [→](planning-with-files.md) |
| **Vercel Skills** | Use it when you want an npm-style CLI to install, find, and update SKILL.md packs across many coding agents. | D (6/6) | [→](vercel-skills.md) |
| **OpenSandbox** | Use it when you must self-host isolated sandboxes to run untrusted agent-generated code at K8s scale with egress controls and a credential vault — but the repo is only months old (created 2025-12), so its API and Lindy track record are unproven. | B (5/6) | [→](opensandbox.md) |
| **AgentsView** | Use it when you run several coding agents and want local-first cross-agent session search and token/cost analytics — but it's months-old and pre-1.0, expect churn. | B (6/6) | [→](agentsview.md) |
| **Agent Orchestrator** | Use it when you supervise several parallel coding agents on real branches and want a desktop control plane that isolates each in a git worktree and auto-routes CI/review/conflict feedback — but it's ~4.5 months old, pre-1.0, single-User-owned, with a loopback-no-auth daemon. | B (5/6) | [→](agent-orchestrator.md) |

## What belongs here

Infrastructure an AI **coding agent** uses to track work and carry state — task/issue graphs, session capture, planning / context plumbing. Not LLM-agnostic memory libraries (see `agent-memory`), not agent runtimes (see `agent-frameworks`).
