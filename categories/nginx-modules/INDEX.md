## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **lua-nginx-module (ngx_lua)** | Use it when you need real per-request programmability on NGINX (auth, routing, rate-limit) via LuaJIT cosockets — but one blocking call stalls a worker, and you're bound to OpenResty's version-coupled, founder-concentrated core. | D (5/6) | [→](lua-nginx-module.md) |
| **lua-resty-redis** | Use it when your OpenResty edge logic must hit Redis non-blocking on the request hot path with pooling and pipelining — but it works only inside ngx_lua and has no built-in Redis Cluster slot-routing. | D (4/6) | [→](lua-resty-redis.md) |
| **nginx-upload-module** | Use it when you want NGINX to stream large multipart uploads to disk and hand your backend just file metadata — but you're compiling an aging, single-maintainer C fork (last push 2024-07); direct-to-S3 presigned uploads often beat it now. | ? (2/6) | [→](nginx-upload-module.md) |
