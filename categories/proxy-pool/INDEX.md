## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **proxy_pool** | Use it when a scraper needs a rotating pool of free proxy IPs behind a simple API — accepting that free proxies are unreliable and insecure. | A (4/6) | [→](proxy-pool.md) |
| **ProxyBroker** | Use it when you need a throwaway pool of free public proxies for a low-stakes prototype via a single rotating local endpoint — but it's effectively frozen since ~2018 and widely breaks on modern Python without pinning. | D (4/6) | [→](proxybroker.md) |
| **Scylla** | Use it when you want an always-on, self-hosted free-proxy pool with a JSON API, quality scoring, and dashboard via one Docker command — but its forward proxy can't do HTTPS, and releases stalled since 2022. | C (3/6) | [→](scylla.md) |
| **haipproxy** | Use it when you genuinely need a distributed, high-availability free-proxy pool for large multi-machine crawls on Scrapy+Redis — but it's dormant since 2022, runs 2018-era Py2/3 code, and is the heaviest pool to operate. | D (3/6) | [→](haipproxy.md) |

## What belongs here

Self-hosted **rotating proxy-IP pools** for web scraping. Not scraping frameworks themselves, not web/browser automation (see `web-automation`).
