## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **whistle** | Use it when a web/mobile dev must capture, inspect, rewrite, and mock HTTP(S)/WebSocket traffic via a rule-based web UI — a dev proxy, not a production gateway or scraping pool. | B (6/6) | [→](whistle.md) |
| **AnyProxy** | Use it when you want a scriptable Node.js MITM proxy to inspect and rewrite HTTP/HTTPS traffic in plain JS rules — but master is frozen since 2020, so prefer whistle for new work. | C (4/6) | [→](anyproxy.md) |

## What belongs here

Proxies whose primary job is **capturing, inspecting, rewriting, and mocking** HTTP(S)/WebSocket traffic for development and debugging. Not production API/AI gateways (see `api-gateway`), not scraping proxy pools (see `proxy-pool`).
