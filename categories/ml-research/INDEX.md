## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **autoresearch** | Self-contained single-GPU LLM training harness so an AI agent can iterate on train.py overnight — 5-minute experiments scored by validation bits-per-byte, keeping only loss-lowering changes. | D (5/6) | [→](autoresearch.md) |
| **llm-circuit-finder** | Python toolkit that searches a GGUF model for contiguous reasoning-circuit layer blocks and duplicates them in the forward pass (no training, no weight edits), validated with built-in probes. | D (5/6) | [→](llm-circuit-finder.md) |
| **CLIP** | Use it when you need zero-shot image classification or image↔text retrieval embeddings — the original frozen reference; OpenCLIP has more checkpoints. | C (5/6) | [→](clip.md) |
| **TaskMatrix** | Use it only to study an early visual-tool-routing agent (Visual ChatGPT) — abandoned since ~2024, don't build on it. | ? (2/6) | [→](taskmatrix.md) |
| **PyTorch-GAN** | Read it to learn GAN architectures from clean reference implementations — idle since 2024 and superseded by diffusion; not production code. | D (4/6) | [→](pytorch-gan.md) |
| **LSTM Neural Network for Time Series Prediction** | Use it as a readable article-companion example for learning Keras LSTM time-series forecasting — pinned to EOL TF1/Python 3.5 and AGPL-3.0, re-implement from the article rather than vendoring. | E (4/6) | [→](lstm-time-series.md) |
| **Agriculture Knowledge Graph (AgriKG)** | Use it as a complete blueprint and bundled datasets for a Chinese domain knowledge-graph pipeline (NER, RE, Neo4j, Django) — author-declared unmaintained on a dated GPL-3.0 stack, lift techniques not code. | D (3/6) | [→](agriculture-knowledge-graph.md) |
| **Senta (SKEP)** | Use it when working inside PaddlePaddle/ERNIE and needing SKEP sentiment checkpoints with a published method — pinned to EOL PaddlePaddle 1.6.3, so environment archaeology is unavoidable. | D (3/6) | [→](senta.md) |
| **Depth Anything V2** | Use it as the current default monocular-depth foundation model for single-image depth in PyTorch/Transformers — only the Small weights are Apache-2.0; Base/Large/Giant are CC-BY-NC-4.0 (non-commercial). | B (4/6) | [→](depth-anything-v2.md) |
| **pymoo** | Use it as the de-facto Python library for evolutionary multi-objective optimization (NSGA-II/III, MOEA/D) to find Pareto fronts — for convex/linear/single-objective problems an LP/gradient solver is far faster. | C (6/6) | [→](pymoo.md) |

## What belongs here

Small, self-contained **ML research demos** and reference implementations meant to read and learn from, not to productionize. Not training frameworks (see `llm-training`).
