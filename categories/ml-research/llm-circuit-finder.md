# llm-circuit-finder

A small Python toolkit that searches a GGUF model for contiguous "reasoning circuits" and duplicates those layer blocks in the forward pass — no training, no weight edits, just re-routing hidden states through the same layers twice — then validates the effect with probes and lm-evaluation-harness.

## When to use

You're a hobbyist or independent researcher with a couple of consumer GPUs and a quantized GGUF of some open model (Devstral, Qwen2.5-Coder, Phi-4, whatever you have locally). You read David Ng's RYS post about duplicating layers to make a model "think twice," and you want to actually try it on *your* model without renting an H200 or kicking off a fine-tune. The problem is that "which layers do I duplicate?" has no general answer — the right block is model-specific and the boundaries are sharp. llm-circuit-finder is built for exactly this loop: `sweep.py` performs GGUF surgery to physically duplicate layer ranges, spins up `llama-server` on the modified model, runs three probe suites (math, EQ, BBH-derived reasoning), scores against baseline, deletes the temp GGUF, and moves to the next config — coarse blocks first to find the hot zone, then stride-1 to pin the exact boundaries. Once you've found a circuit, `layer_path.py` lets you bake an explicit execution path (`0..9,7,8,9,10..63`) into a new GGUF and `compare_eval.py` confirms it on standard benchmarks. It's a learn-by-running research demo, not a product: you keep the artifacts (the modified GGUF, the eval JSON) and own the whole pipeline.

## When NOT to use

- **You need reliable, general capability gains.** The repo's own checked-in evals show the trade is real but *not* free: the Devstral-24B surgery raises causal judgement and GSM8k but *drops* IFEval, MBPP, and date understanding — average across all metrics went slightly **down** (0.7610 → 0.7488). This buys a cognitive-profile shift, not a free upgrade.
- **You're not running GGUF / llama.cpp.** The entire pipeline is GGUF + `llama-server`. There's no HF-transformers or vLLM path; PyTorch-checkpoint or API-only models are out of scope.
- **You want a maintained, versioned library.** It's a single-author research demo with no tagged release and no test suite; treat it as code to read and adapt, not a dependency to pin.
- **You can't spare extra VRAM/latency.** Duplicated layers are physical copies in the GGUF — ~1.5 GiB extra for 3 layers on a 24B model and inference slows roughly in proportion to the added layers (~7.5% for 3 extra of 40).
- **You want statistically rigorous claims.** Headline deltas come from small probe suites and `--limit`-capped eval runs on a handful of tasks; they're directional findings on specific models, not benchmarked guarantees.
- **You expect it to "just work" on any model.** The circuit location and size differ per architecture; you have to run the sweep to find them, and a one-layer shift can erase or invert the effect.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| RYS / `mergekit` passthrough (layer-stacking model merges) | 未收录 | mergekit's `passthrough` method also duplicates/stacks layers, but it's a general model-merging toolkit aimed at producing a finished merged model; llm-circuit-finder adds the *search* loop (sweep + probes) to discover *which* block to duplicate and validate it. |
| lm-evaluation-harness | 未收录 | The standard benchmark runner this repo calls out to for validation; it measures models but doesn't perform or search layer surgery. |
| Mechanistic-interpretability circuit tooling (e.g. TransformerLens) | 未收录 | Studies circuits via activation patching/ablation on HF models for *understanding*; this repo is a coarse, capability-oriented "duplicate whole layer blocks in GGUF and measure" demo, not feature-level interp. |
| Fine-tuning / LoRA stacks | 未收录 | Change weights to improve a capability; this is orthogonal (no training) and the author notes you can stack both. Different cost/benefit and reproducibility profile. |

## Tech stack

- **Language:** Python (≈3.10+), a set of standalone CLI scripts (`sweep.py`, `layer_path.py`, `gguf_surgery.py`, probe scripts, `compare_eval.py`, `visualize.py`).
- **Model format / runtime:** GGUF models served by `llama.cpp`'s `llama-server` (CPU, CUDA, Vulkan, or Metal builds).
- **Core mechanism:** GGUF layer-duplication "surgery" producing a modified model with an explicit layer execution path, written to tmpfs (`/dev/shm`) and deleted per test.
- **Evaluation:** built-in math / EQ / BBH-derived reasoning probes; optional EleutherAI lm-evaluation-harness for standard benchmarks (BBH, GSM8k, IFEval, MBPP).
- **Viz:** optional `matplotlib` text/PNG heatmaps of sweep results.

## Dependencies

- **Required Python:** `gguf`, `requests`, `tqdm` (per the README quick-start `pip install`).
- **External binaries:** a built `llama.cpp` (`llama-server`) with the right backend for your hardware.
- **Optional:** `lm-eval` (lm-evaluation-harness) for benchmark validation; `matplotlib` for heatmaps.
- **Hardware:** Linux; enough VRAM/RAM to hold the model plus the extra duplicated layers. Author developed on two AMD consumer GPUs (RX 7900 XT + RX 6950 XT) and ran fuller evals on a rented H200.

## Ops difficulty

**Medium.** No service to deploy and no training infra, but you must build llama.cpp for your backend, have a GGUF model on disk, and wire `llama-server` ports/devices correctly; sweeps spawn/kill servers and write large temp GGUFs to tmpfs, so you need the RAM and disk headroom. Validation via lm-evaluation-harness adds its own setup. It's a run-it-yourself research script, so expect to read the code and tune flags rather than follow a turnkey path; no packaging, versioning, or CI to lean on.

## Health & viability

- **Maintenance (as of 2026-06):** last pushed 2026-03 (~2026-03-20), no tagged release, no test suite or CI visible. [推断] Recently active but with the shape of a one-off research drop, not a maintained tool — there's no cadence to track.
- **Governance / bus factor:** a **single-author** repo under a personal account with only ~239 stars — minimal bus factor and no community process. If the author stops, it stops; you should expect to read and adapt the scripts yourself rather than file issues and wait.
- **Age & Lindy verdict (created 2026-03, ~0 yr):** brand-new and tiny. [推断] **Unproven by Lindy** — neither old nor widely adopted; its credibility rests on the technique (RYS layer-duplication) and the author's own checked-in evals, not on survival or usage. Treat it as a learn-by-running demo.
- **Risk flags:** README claims MIT but GitHub's API detected no license file as of 2026-06 — a real licensing ambiguity to resolve before depending on it. Results are directional (small probe suites, `--limit`-capped runs) and the headline gains are net-negative on some metrics, so don't read it as a validated capability boost. [未验证]

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] License is stated as "MIT" in the README, but GitHub's API reports no detected license file (no SPDX match) for the repo as of 2026-06 — verify a LICENSE file before relying on it.
- [未验证] Star count ~239 and last push 2026-03-20 as of 2026-06; GitHub stars are unreliable and date-sensitive — treat as indicative only.
- [未验证] Headline result claims (e.g. logical deduction 0.22→0.76, reasoning +23% on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, the Devstral all-metric average 0.7610→0.7488) are the author's own probe/eval numbers on specific quantized models with capped sample sizes; not independently reproduced here.
- [未验证] The README's one-line summary cites "Qwen2.5-32B" while the Results section uses "Qwen2.5-Coder-32B" and gives different duplicated-layer indices (7-9 vs the summary's "3 specific layers"); the exact model/layers for each headline figure should be read off the results folder, not the summary.
- [推断] No tagged release, test suite, or CI is visible in the file tree, so the "maturity: research demo" framing is inferred from repo structure (standalone scripts + a results/ folder), not a declared project status.
- [推断] "Works on most transformer models" is the author's expectation extrapolated from Mistral/Qwen2 architectures and Ng's Qwen2-72B work; it is not verified across architectures.
