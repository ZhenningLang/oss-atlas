# Apache Superset

A self-hosted, enterprise-grade BI web application: explore SQL databases through a no-code chart builder and SQL Lab, then assemble the results into interactive dashboards backed by a lightweight semantic layer.

## When to use

You're a data or analytics engineer on a team that already has a SQL warehouse (Postgres, BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Trino, etc.) and a growing demand for self-service dashboards. Analysts keep pinging you for one-off charts, and the business wants shared, refreshable dashboards instead of screenshots pasted into decks. You don't want to send your warehouse credentials to a SaaS BI vendor, and you'd rather own the deployment than pay per-seat. You stand up Superset, point it at the warehouse over its SQLAlchemy connector, and let analysts write queries in SQL Lab, save them as datasets, and build charts in the no-code explorer — defining reusable metrics and calculated columns in the semantic layer so "revenue" means the same thing on every dashboard. Row-level security and role-based access keep each team scoped to its own data.

You also reach for it when you need broad chart variety and dashboard interactivity (cross-filters, drill-downs, native filters) over warehouse tables, and when you want dashboard definitions and database connections to live in a system you control and can export/import as code. Because it speaks SQLAlchemy, it connects to most SQL engines without a bespoke driver per source, making it the BI front-end for whatever warehouse you actually query.

## When NOT to use

- **You need metrics/observability dashboards, not warehouse BI.** Superset queries SQL data sources for analytics; for time-series infra metrics, logs, and alerting over Prometheus/Loki/InfluxDB, that's [Grafana](../observability/grafana.md) — a different category of tool. Don't bend Superset into a monitoring console.
- **Your data is unstructured, log, or document-shaped.** It is a SQL BI layer. It has no native story for raw log search, full-text/document analytics, or NoSQL stores that don't expose a SQL/SQLAlchemy dialect.
- **You want a single-process, low-ops deploy.** Production Superset is a multi-service stack — web app + a metadata database + a cache (Redis) + Celery workers (and Celery Beat) for async queries, alerts, and scheduled reports. Running and upgrading that is real ops burden; if you want the simplest possible setup, Metabase is closer to a single-jar/single-container experience.
- **You expect Superset to model or move your data.** It is a *read/visualize* layer, not an ETL/ELT or transformation tool. It does not extract, load, or materialize pipelines; do your modeling upstream (dbt, your warehouse, an orchestrator) and point Superset at the result. Its semantic layer is lightweight (metrics/calculated columns/virtual datasets), not a full modeling language. [推断]
- **You need polished embedded analytics as a core product surface.** Embedded SDK / dashboard embedding exists, but its capabilities, theming, and licensing fit are something to verify against your specific embedding requirements before committing. [未验证]
- **Tiny team, few dashboards, no warehouse.** If you have a handful of CSVs and one analyst, the operational weight of the full stack outweighs the payoff versus a notebook or a lighter tool.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Metabase | 未收录 | Open-source BI with a far simpler deploy (single jar/container) and a friendlier no-SQL question builder; easier for non-technical users, but a lighter semantic/customization story and less raw-SQL/chart depth than Superset. |
| [Grafana](../observability/grafana.md) | ✅ | Observability-first dashboards over time-series/metrics/logs (Prometheus, Loki, InfluxDB) with strong alerting; can query SQL too, but it is built for monitoring panels, not warehouse-style ad-hoc BI exploration. |
| Redash | 未收录 | Query-centric: write SQL, save queries, build dashboards from them; simpler model and lighter than Superset, but a narrower visualization set and a weaker semantic/governance layer. |
| Tableau / Power BI | 未收录 | Proprietary, commercial BI with mature visuals, data prep, and enterprise support; richer polish and ecosystem, but licensing cost, vendor lock-in, and (for Power BI) Microsoft-stack gravity — not self-hosted open source. |
| Looker | 未收录 | Proprietary (Google) BI built around LookML, a real modeling language and governed semantic layer; stronger modeling/governance than Superset's lightweight layer, but commercial, locked-in, and priced for the enterprise. |

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Python / Flask (Flask App Builder) with SQLAlchemy as the database-access layer; a REST API exposes most operations.
- **Frontend:** TypeScript / React single-page app; charts render via a plugin-based visualization framework.
- **Data access:** connects to any database with a SQLAlchemy dialect / DB-API driver — 50+ engines including Postgres, MySQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks, Trino/Presto, ClickHouse, and more.
- **Async/processing:** Celery workers (plus Celery Beat scheduler) handle async SQL Lab queries, cache warm-up, alerts, and scheduled reports.
- **Caching:** a configurable cache (commonly Redis) for query results and metadata; results caching is pluggable.
- **Semantic layer:** datasets with metrics, calculated columns, and virtual (SQL-defined) datasets, plus row-level security rules.

## Dependencies

- **Metadata database (required):** a SQL database Superset uses for its own state — dashboards, charts, users, connections. SQLite works for local trials only; production wants Postgres or MySQL.
- **Cache / message broker (effectively required at scale):** Redis (or equivalent) for caching and as the Celery broker/result backend.
- **Celery workers (required for async features):** one or more workers, and Celery Beat, to run async queries, alerts, scheduled reports, and cache warm-up. Without them, async SQL Lab and reporting don't function.
- **A SQL data source (yours to run):** the actual analytical database/warehouse you point Superset at — Superset stores no analytical data itself.
- **Web server / runtime:** a WSGI/ASGI app server (e.g. Gunicorn) for the Flask app; official Docker images and a Helm chart are published for deployment. [未验证]

## Ops difficulty

**Medium-to-high.** A `docker compose` quickstart gets you a demo in minutes, but that is explicitly not a production topology. A real deployment means running and coordinating several moving parts: the web app, a metadata Postgres/MySQL, Redis, and Celery workers + Beat — each needing to be sized, secured, monitored, and upgraded together. Upgrades involve database migrations (Alembic) and occasionally breaking config/feature-flag changes, so version bumps need testing. You also own auth integration (LDAP/OAuth/OIDC via Flask App Builder), row-level security configuration, secret management for database connections, and tuning cache + async timeouts so heavy queries don't wedge the workers. The connector to each warehouse adds its own driver and credential management. None of it is exotic, but it is a genuine multi-service application to operate — closer to running a web platform than dropping in a single binary.

## Health & viability

- **Maintenance (as of 2026-06):** last pushed 2026-06, not archived, at v6.x — a continuously released, heavily maintained project; ~903 open issues reflects scale and breadth of use, not neglect. [推断]
- **Governance & backing:** an **Apache Software Foundation** top-level project — foundation governance, a PMC rather than a single maintainer or vendor, and ASF's relicense/IP guardrails. This is about the strongest governance posture in the index: no one company can unilaterally rug-pull the license. [推断]
- **Age & Lindy verdict:** created 2015-07, so ~11 years old **and still active** — a textbook **strong Lindy** bet: long-lived, foundation-backed, widely deployed. Old + active ⇒ durable. [推断]
- **Adoption/ecosystem:** broad enterprise/production adoption, 50+ SQLAlchemy database connectors, a plugin-based viz framework, and mature docs — deep ecosystem and a wide dependent base. [未验证]
- **Risk flags:** no relicense or open-core trap (Apache-2.0, ASF-governed). The real "risk" is operational, not viability: it is a genuine multi-service stack (metadata DB + Redis + Celery) to run and upgrade — see Ops difficulty, not a sustainability concern.

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] Latest release reported as v6.1.0 (2026-05); ~73.6k GitHub stars as of 2026-06 — star counts and version numbers are date-sensitive and shift release-to-release, treat as indicative.
- [未验证] "50+ database connectors" and the specific engine list come from the project's own framing; the supported set and each connector's maturity vary — verify the exact engine/driver you depend on against the current docs.
- [未验证] Official Docker images and a Helm chart for production deployment are stated from general knowledge of the project, not re-confirmed line-by-line against the current repo here.
- [未验证] Embedded analytics / dashboard-embedding capabilities and any licensing constraints were not verified for this page; confirm against current docs before relying on them.
- [推断] Calling the semantic layer "lightweight" (vs LookML-style modeling) is an inference from its metrics/calculated-column/virtual-dataset model, not a measured comparison.
- [推断] Production requiring metadata DB + Redis + Celery workers is inferred from the standard documented architecture; a stripped-down single-service deploy may be possible for limited use but isn't the supported production path.
