## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cython** | Use it when a profiled hot Python loop needs near-C speed or you must wrap a C/C++ library — but it forces a C compiler and per-platform wheel build pipeline. | A (6/6) | [→](cython.md) |
| **pyrasite** | Use it when you must inject diagnostic code into a stuck or leaking live Python process you can't restart — but injection can crash the target, treat it as incident-only. | C (4/6) | [→](pyrasite.md) |
| **memory-analyzer** | Use it when you need a one-shot per-type memory snapshot of a live Python 3 process via GDB — but Meta **archived** it (last code 2021, targets EOL 3.6/3.7), so prefer a maintained tool like memray/tracemalloc. | D (5/6) | [→](memory-analyzer.md) |
| **gophernotes** | Use it when you want interactive Go cells in a Jupyter notebook for exploration or tutorials — but it's stalled since 2023 and runs an interpreter, not standard Go. | D (3/6) | [→](gophernotes.md) |
| **GRequests** | Use it when you want to make existing synchronous `requests` code concurrent with minimal diff via `map()` — but gevent monkeypatches the stdlib and can collide with your stack. | C (4/6) | [→](grequests.md) |
| **uv** | Use it when you want an extremely fast Python package manager and project tool that replaces pip, poetry, and pyenv with a single Rust binary and universal lockfile — but it's only ~3 years old and some edge cases in dependency resolution are still being ironed out. | ? (0/6) | [→](uv.md) |
