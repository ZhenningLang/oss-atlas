## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ImageMagick** | Use a broad command-line suite and APIs to create, edit, compose, and convert images across 200+ formats. | B (5/6) | [→](imagemagick.md) |
| **sharp** | Build high-throughput Node.js pipelines for resizing and converting existing raster images through libvips. | A (6/6) | [→](sharp.md) |
| **Screenshot Service** | Render controlled HTML and CSS to PNG, JPEG, or WebP through a tiny internal HTTP service that you can isolate and harden. | D (4/6) | [→](screenshot-service.md) |

## Comparison matrix

| Option | Indexed | Health | One-line tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [ImageMagick](imagemagick.md) | ✅ | B (5/6) | Pick for broad format coverage, command-line automation, and general image composition; it is less natural than sharp inside a Node.js hot path and cannot lay out arbitrary HTML like a browser. |
| [sharp](sharp.md) | ✅ | A (6/6) | Pick for fast in-process Node.js transforms of existing images; it avoids Chromium overhead but does not render HTML, CSS, or web fonts. |
| [Screenshot Service](screenshot-service.md) | ✅ | D (4/6) | Pick only for trusted HTML behind an isolated internal endpoint; browser fidelity comes with Chromium cost, unsafe defaults, no established repository license, and substantial hardening work. |
| Browserless | 未收录 | — | Pick for a shared headless-browser service with queueing, concurrency, and session controls; it has a much larger operational surface and SSPL/commercial licensing constraints. |
| capture-website-cli | 未收录 | — | Pick for one-off or scripted webpage captures from a CLI with rich capture flags; it is simpler than operating an API service but does not provide pooling, tenancy, or a persistent rendering endpoint. |
