## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **FFmpeg** | The universal audio/video framework — `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`/`ffplay` CLIs plus the `libav*` libraries that decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, and filter virtually any media format in existence. | A (3/6) | [→](ffmpeg.md) |
| **ffmpeg-python** | Python bindings for FFmpeg that let you build complex filter graphs as chained Python expressions instead of hand-writing `-filter_complex` strings — it constructs the FFmpeg command line for you and shells out to the `ffmpeg` binary. | C (4/6) | [→](ffmpeg-python.md) |
| **ffsubsync** | A language-agnostic CLI that automatically re-times an out-of-sync subtitle file against the video (or a reference subtitle), aligning speech segments via FFT cross-correlation. | B (5/6) | [→](ffsubsync.md) |
| **GStreamer** | A pipeline-based multimedia framework for building real-time audio/video processing applications — not a CLI tool, but a graph of pluggable elements you wire together in code. | A (4/6) | [→](gstreamer.md) |
| **HandBrake** | Open-source video transcoder for converting video from nearly any format to modern, widely supported codecs — built on FFmpeg, x264, and x265 with a preset-driven GUI and a matching `HandBrakeCLI` command-line tool. | A (4/6) | [→](handbrake.md) |
| **m3u8** | A Python parser and serializer for HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) `.m3u8` playlists — load a playlist from a URL, file, or string into a typed object model, inspect/modify segments and variants, and dump it back out (RFC 8216). | C (4/6) | [→](m3u8.md) |
| **MLT** | A multimedia framework for building non-linear video editors (NLEs) — timeline tracks, clips, transitions, filters, and compositing, with the actual codec work delegated to FFmpeg/libav underneath. Not a standalone editor; it's the engine that powers Shotcut and Kdenlive. | B (5/6) | [→](mlt.md) |
| **MoviePy** | A Python library for programmatic video editing — cutting, concatenating, compositing, text overlays, and effects — that builds FFmpeg commands under the hood but presents a higher-level, friendlier API. | B (5/6) | [→](moviepy.md) |
| **PyAV** | Pythonic bindings to FFmpeg's `libav*` libraries — in-process decode/encode with frame-by-frame access to NumPy arrays and Python bytes, no subprocess spawning. | A (6/6) | [→](pyav.md) |
| **OpenAI Whisper** | OpenAI's general-purpose automatic speech recognition model that transcribes and translates audio to English across 99 languages, with multiple size/quality tradeoffs. | B (5/6) | [→](whisper.md) |
