# gstack

Garry Tan's personal Claude Code setup: ~23 opinionated slash-command skills that role-play a virtual engineering team (CEO review, designer, eng-manager, release manager, doc engineer, QA, security officer) and drive a plan → build → review → ship → retro loop.

## When to use

You're a solo founder or small-team developer who lives in Claude Code, and you keep doing the "team" work in your own head: deciding whether a feature is even worth building, locking the architecture before coding, doing a design pass, QA-ing your own work, then writing release notes and shipping. You want that whole assembly line as named, repeatable steps instead of ad-hoc prompts you retype every session. You clone gstack into `~/.claude/skills/`, run its `./setup`, and now you have slash commands like `/office-hours` (product interrogation), `/plan-eng-review` (architecture lock), `/review`, `/qa`, `/cso` (security audit), `/ship`, `/document-release`, and `/retro` — each a persona that interrogates the work from one role's angle.

You reach for it when you'd rather adopt one person's battle-tested, end-to-end harness wholesale than assemble your own skill stack command-by-command. It's explicitly "how Garry Tan does it" — an opinionated software-factory workflow he uses daily — so the value is the *taste and sequencing* baked into those 23 commands, not a generic toolbox. Install once; the commands then activate through Claude Code's native skill-loading, and `setup` can also fan the same commands out to other detected agents (Codex CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Droid, and others) [未验证].

## When NOT to use

- **You already run a curated command/skill system you trust.** gstack is prescriptive and personality-driven (a CEO that second-guesses your roadmap, an eng-manager that locks architecture). Layering it over an existing workflow stack creates competing slash commands and double-routing — pick one source of truth.
- **You want a runtime/library/CLI to import.** The deliverable is a bag of prompt-defined skills, not an API or service. Outside a supporting agent harness, the markdown does nothing.
- **You're off the supported harnesses.** It activates via Claude Code's skill loader (and claims auto-detection for ~10 other agents). On a bespoke or unsupported agent there's no loader to fire the commands.
- **You don't want the install footprint.** Setup clones into `~/.claude/skills/`, symlinks per-skill dirs, can write `.gstack/` state, and a "browse daemon" auto-starts; team mode commits `.claude/` + `CLAUDE.md` into your repo. That's heavier than dropping in a few `.md` files.
- **Single-maintainer, one person's taste.** This is one founder's personal config, no tagged releases; commands and their behavior can shift with any push, and the workflow encodes his preferences, not a community standard.
- **Advisory, not enforced.** "Reviews" and "locks" are prompt-level instructions the agent can still ignore; nothing here is a hard gate in CI.

## Comparison

| Alternative | In index | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| [Superpowers](../../agent-dev-methodology/superpowers.md) | ✅ | Composable SDLC skills library (brainstorm → plan → TDD → verify) shipped as a cross-harness plugin. More TDD/test-first discipline and a marketplace install; gstack is one founder's *role-based* command set (CEO/designer/QA personas) tuned to his daily factory rather than a generic methodology. |
| antfu/skills | 未收录 | Another personal Claude Code skill collection; compare on which workflow each author bakes in and how much it assumes about your setup. |
| Dimillian/Skills | 未收录 | Personal skill collection; pick by author taste and how their commands route. |
| wshobson/agents | 未收录 | Large subagent/persona collection; broader catalog of agents vs. gstack's tighter founder-opinionated factory loop. |
| Building your own commands from scratch | 未收录 | Maximum fit, zero lock-in, but you author and maintain every persona and the sequencing yourself. |

## Caveats (unverified)

- [未验证] License MIT and primary language TypeScript per GitHub metadata as of 2026-06-26; repo last pushed 2026-06-25; no GitHub release/tag was reported (`latestRelease: null`), so there is no stable version to pin — re-verify before relying on specific command behavior.
- [未验证] Star count (~116k per GitHub on 2026-06-26) is unreliable and date-sensitive; treat as indicative only, not a quality signal.
- [未验证] The "23 tools"/command list (e.g. `/office-hours`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/review`, `/qa`, `/cso`, `/ship`, `/document-release`, `/retro`) is drawn from the project README; the exact set and naming change with the repo and should be read from the current `skills/` directory, not this page.
- [未验证] Claimed support for ~10 AI coding agents (Codex CLI, OpenCode, Cursor, Factory Droid, Slate, Kiro, Hermes, GBrain, etc.) via `./setup --host` auto-detection is from the README; per-agent activation fidelity is not independently confirmed here.
- [未验证] Install/runtime requirements (Git, Bun v1.0+, optional Node on Windows, an auto-starting "browse daemon", optional Supabase/PGLite for a memory feature) are from the README and not verified by running setup.
- [推断] Because behavior lives in prompt/markdown skills loaded by the agent, every "review"/"lock"/"gate" is advisory — the agent can deviate; treat these as guidance, not enforced controls.
- [推断] As one person's personal config with no releases, breaking changes can land on any push; vendor the version you tested if you need stability.
