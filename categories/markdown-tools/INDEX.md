## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CommonMark** | Use it when you need the canonical, spec-compliant Markdown reference implementation with a traversable AST — but not for speed, GFM, or a plugin ecosystem. | — | [→](commonmark.md) |
| **Markdown Here** | Use it when you want to write email in Markdown and render it before sending via a browser/Thunderbird extension — mind its slow maintenance. | C (4/6) | [→](markdown-here.md) |
| **marked** | Use it when you need a fast, low-level Markdown→HTML parser in JS — but you must sanitize the output yourself and don't need strict CommonMark. | A (5/6) | [→](marked.md) |
| **remark** | Use it when you need a full mdast AST pipeline for parsing, transforming, linting, and serializing Markdown — but it's a toolchain, not a one-call renderer. | — | [→](remark.md) |
| **markdown-it** | Use it when you need a strict CommonMark/GFM-compliant, pluggable Markdown→HTML parser in JS — but the plugin ecosystem adds weight and you must still sanitize untrusted input. | — | [→](markdown-it.md) |
| **micromark** | Use it when you need a low-level, streaming-friendly CommonMark/GFM tokenizer in JS — the engine underneath remark — but you must build the rendering layer yourself. | — | [→](micromark.md) |

## What belongs here

Tools whose primary job is **parsing, rendering, or authoring Markdown** — parsers, converters, and editor extensions. Not document parsing into structured data for gen-AI (see `document-parsing`), not diagram-from-text generators (see `diagramming`).
