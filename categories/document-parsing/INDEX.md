## Projects in this category

| Project | Use when | Health | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Docling** | Use it when you must parse messy PDF/DOCX/PPTX into clean structured Markdown/JSON for RAG ingestion — a parser, not a DMS. | A (5/6) | [→](docling.md) |
| **MarkItDown** | Use it when you need a lightweight Python library to convert various office documents and files to Markdown for LLM ingestion — simpler than Docling but less layout-aware. | ? (0/6) | [→](markitdown.md) |
| **olmOCR** | Use it when you must convert complex PDFs with equations, tables, handwriting, and multi-column layouts into clean Markdown for LLM training datasets — requires a GPU. | ? (0/6) | [→](olmocr.md) |
| **Marker** | Convert PDF to markdown + JSON quickly with high accuracy | ? (0/6) | [→](marker.md) |
| **unstructured** | Convert documents to structured data effortlessly. Unstructured is open-source ETL solution for transforming complex documents into clean, structured formats for language models.

| **any2html** | Use it when you need any2html in this category. | ? (0/6) | [→](any2html.md) |
| **Dedoc** | Use it when an on-premises Python pipeline needs multi-format documents recovered as logical trees with tables, annotations, and attachments; expect a heavy Linux/system-package stack and limits on difficult scans. | A (5/6) | [→](dedoc.md) |
| **Bella Domify** | Use it when Chinese RAG ingestion needs detailed PDF/Office DOM trees plus FastAPI/Kafka/S3 service integration; license ambiguity, optional remote OCR, and heavy infrastructure are decisive constraints. | D (5/6) | [→](bella-domify.md) |
| **MinerU Skill** | Use it when a coding agent needs one-command cloud document-to-Markdown through CLI/MCP, with batch, resume, or content-tool delivery; files cross a service boundary and remain subject to quotas and API changes. | C (5/6) | [→](mineru-skill.md) |


## Comparison matrix

| Option | Indexed | Health | One-line tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Docling](docling.md) | ✅ | A (5/6) | Rich-document parsing (layout + tables) to structured Markdown/JSON; heavier model deps than plain text extraction. |
| [MarkItDown](markitdown.md) | ✅ | ? (0/6) | Lightweight Python library converting office documents and files to Markdown for LLM ingestion; simpler than Docling but less layout-aware. |
| [olmOCR](olmocr.md) | ✅ | ? (0/6) | VLM-based PDF linearization for LLM datasets; handles equations, tables, and handwriting but requires GPU. |
| [PageIndex](../rag-retrieval/pageindex.md) | ✅ | B (5/6) | Builds a retrieval index over long structured docs — downstream of parsing, not a parser. |
| [any2html](any2html.md) | ✅ | ? (0/6) | Use it when you need any2html in this category. |
| [Dedoc](dedoc.md) | ✅ | A (5/6) | Multi-format logical-tree parsing with tables, annotations, and attachments; deeper than lightweight Markdown conversion, but heavier on Linux dependencies and limited on difficult scans. |
| [Bella Domify](bella-domify.md) | ✅ | D (5/6) | Detailed pdf2docx-derived DOM trees and service hooks; rich layout objects, but heavy infrastructure, optional outbound OCR, and an unresolved GPL v2/v3 declaration conflict. |
| [MinerU Skill](mineru-skill.md) | ✅ | C (5/6) | Agent-facing CLI/MCP over MinerU's cloud API with batch, resume, and delivery; avoids local model deployment but adds upload, quota, and third-party API risk. |
| LlamaParse / self-hosted MinerU | 未收录 | — | Cloud and self-hosted document-parsing routes named across the pages. |


## What belongs here

Libraries whose primary job is **parsing/converting documents into structured representations** for gen-AI/RAG. Not retrieval/indexing itself (see `rag-retrieval`), not document archiving/search (see `document-management`), not raw OCR (see `ocr`).
